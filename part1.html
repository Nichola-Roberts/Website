<p>You know the feeling. You just got home from work. It’s been a long, hard day, and you collapse on the sofa. You don’t have the energy for anything. You know you have to cook dinner, to do your washing, but you can’t. You can’t even begin to think about doing them. Because you’re completely out of energy.
</p>
<p>You’re sitting there, trying to block out your thoughts, trying to focus on the tv. But your partner comes over and asks you how your day was. You snap at them. You don’t mean to. But replying is impossible. Your brain just wants to shut down. You don’t have the energy.
</p>
<p>When you start looking at life from this perspective—that you have a mental energy limit you can’t push beyond—things start making a lot more sense.
</p>
<h2>Energy Landscape</h2>
<p>Imagine you’re a ball, standing on a path in front of a vast landscape. There are hills, mountains and valleys. There are paths running everywhere. You see them tracing down to the valleys. Winding round the mountains. Branching out and joining back together.
</p>
<p>The valleys are the experiences that feel good: the simplicity of relaxing in a hot bath, a holiday with your family or maybe meeting someone and falling in love.
</p>
<p>The mountains feel huge. They’re stressful to even think about: filling out important application forms, not being able to afford your rent, or the dread of having to face your controlling boss tomorrow. That one's a well worn path you're forced to take, again and again. You know they’re going to be unhappy with you. They always are.
</p>
<p>Sometimes mountains can even represent the things that should be easy. Actions that should come naturally. And moments you’re meant to enjoy. Like a loving conversation with your partner. Some days everything feels uphill.
</p>
<p>You can feel the pull of gravity drawing you down towards the valleys. And the effort of climbing the mountains. You know which paths you want to take. They’re the ones that slope downwards. You don’t even have to map them out.
</p>
<h2>Pathways</h2>
<p>The pathways represent all the actions you could take. From changing the show on netflix to going for a run. Some paths stretch out a long way into the distance. For instance, you can just about make out that old pathway, the one you used to dream of—quitting your job and retraining to follow your passion. Unfortunately, it seems so far away these days.
</p>
<p>Our paths are mapped from our past experiences. Maybe they’re actions we took ourselves, or paths we learnt from others. Some are faint trails we can barely make out. Some are well trodden because we take them every day: our commute to work, our bedtime routine, or singing along to our favourite songs. These paths are carved into our landscape, their grooves so deep that we can walk them automatically.
</p>
<p>But every journey is unique even if we know the pathway well. Take for instance our commute. Each day it's different, we see different cars, different people. One day there might be a massive road accident, then the next day it snows. One day we arrive early, another we’re late. There are infinitely many tiny variations. Each one leads to a slightly different journey. And every deviation subtly evolves our pathways. Our old memories aren’t replaced, they’re just enhanced with new information. Faint new forks mapping out the everchanging details.
</p>
<p>And the more we take these paths the deeper their major highways are etched. Sometimes forged from the repetition of daily life. But that’s not the only mechanism. Intensity can also sear their grooves when something important or impactful happens. Like the day our child was born.
</p>
<p>Or they can be created when something catches our attention, and we become fascinated by the experience. So much so that we keep treading along its paths. Compelled to try small variations to learn its nuances. Each journey adding new footprints trodden into the ground. Eventually creating the grooves that make our future travel more comfortable, and more energy efficient.
</p>
<p>Imagine this scenario.
</p>
<p>You find an incredible Thai restaurant. That first curry feels so amazing. It stays on your mind. You spend all week thinking about it. Telling anyone who will listen. You feel the pull of excitement at the thought of going back. You’re actively updating your landscape to include this restaurant. And it feels kind of exhilarating. You're building a brand new pathway leading right to their doorway.
</p>
<p>Then three months later. You order the same curry. It still tastes exactly the same. It’s still amazing. But it's become normal. The emotions have been processed. The paths already mapped out. So there’s no need for the intensity anymore.
</p>
<h3>Raised Pathways</h3>
<p>Our landscape is our internal map of reality. Our best guess at recreating the outside world. Each journey we take adds new details. And the more we traverse an area, the more accurate our map becomes. Well, hopefully. That’s the ultimate aim. Because the better our map, the more chance we have of navigating our way to the valleys. So over time we hope the altitudes in our mapped terrain overlay closer and closer with the true ground level.
</p>
<p>But sometimes pathways can carry dangerous risks. One incident can change everything. A path that was once safe can shift forever. An accident. An argument. A shameful experience. And suddenly the mere thought of this path fills us with dread and anxiety. Its height rises and the new energy cost stops us taking it so readily in the future.
</p>
<p>Imagine you had a car crash last month. Today you have to drive again, for the first time. You know you should feel relieved to get back to normal, and you do. But you also feel scared. As you walk to the car you sense the terrain begin to rise. The familiar pathway feels very, very different. It’s steeper and much more treacherous. You aren’t sure you want to take it. When you get to the car you need a moment, just to catch your breath. When you finally find the strength to start driving you can feel yourself flinching at every passing car. You want to give up. Leave it for another day. The pathway that was once a deep groove has been seismically raised.
</p>
<h2>Fluctuations</h2>
<p>Our landscapes fluctuate constantly. The ground is always shifting around us and below us. Sometimes the shifts are small. Sometimes they’re monumental.
</p>
<p>Little events can have dramatic consequences. For instance, an unexpected bill arrives in the post. And suddenly, you're halfway up a mountain that wasn’t even there before.
</p>
<p>Or maybe it's a dodgy look from a colleague that instantly triggers your anxiety. It causes a small mountain to form beneath your feet. You lose your focus. It’s hard to concentrate. But, luckily, there’s another fluctuation. A work friend walks past. She notices you’re stressed. You talk it through with her and after a while you’re feeling calmer. The mountain starts to subside. And you can think more clearly again. You start to realise it was probably just your paranoia anyway. Phew. Your focus is free to shift back to your work.
</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a more forceful, purposeful fluctuation. Imagine you’re a teenager instead. Full of life and excitement. You're about to go play football with your friends. However. Just as you’re walking out the door. Your mum shouts your name. She thinks you wound up your brother on purpose. And suddenly you start feeling stressed. It’s awful. But now you can’t go out. You can’t muster up any energy anymore. You just want to go to your bedroom. To be alone. Your mum’s words have formed a mountain.
</p>
<p>Maybe you could flatten this mountain. Maybe you could defend yourself. Maybe your mum might be reasonable. Then you could calm down and go out. Or maybe. Maybe, arguing back might trigger one of her mountains. Lead to an escalation. Even more stress. And probably extra punishment. So, you decide it’s not worth the risk. It’s better to hide in your bedroom.
</p>
<p>Our landscapes are always changing and fluctuating, often because of other people, and based on circumstances we don't know and can't control. It's chaotic, and often seemingly random like the butterfly effect. One small action from someone else has a ripple effect dispersing out into the landscapes of others around them.
</p>
<h2>Energy Limit</h2>
<p>Sometimes these fluctuations can throw us right up to the top of our mountains unexpectedly. These are the moments when life has pushed us too far. When everything feels impossibly hard. When we can feel our heartbeat pounding and the anxiety rising in our chest. The times when it feels too much to bear, like we are about to blow. This is our energy limit. And when we hit it, we lose our ability to think. To do pretty much anything. Well, except feel stressed. All our mental energy is taken up just trying to survive that moment.
</p>
<p>Take these scenarios.
</p>
<p>Your child goes missing at the park. A random fluctuation. But it's devastating to your system. You feel absolute panic. You’re instantly taken to your energy limit. Suddenly the only thing that matters is finding them. You've shifted to survival mode. And all you care about is this one task: finding your child. You’re hypervigilant. Even your partner's affair slips your mind. You scan the park, focusing on any clues you can spot... Oh, wait. There they are… Everything is fine again. That’s a relief… Slowly, the mountain can start to subside.
</p>
<p>As soon as you spotted your child, you could start to relax. You give them a slightly frantic hug and then sit back down on the bench. Over the next few minutes, you quickly return to your baseline. You can feel your heart rate return to normal. And thoughts of the affair creeping back into your mind.
</p>
<p>Or maybe you don’t have a child. Instead, you just had a job interview. You really wanted this job. It felt perfect for you. But you didn’t get it. So now you can't think straight. Your thoughts are spiralling out of control. Your anxiety is intense. You're trapped up at your energy limit, unable to escape your own mind. The same thoughts keep going round and round.
</p>
<p>The thoughts spiral. You really need to get your act together. Everyone is going to think you’re a failure if you keep getting rejected from these jobs. Your mind goes over all the stupid things you said. Like you laughed at their jokes too hard. It came across as desperate, didn’t it? And that stupid answer you gave. Why did you not think before you spoke? You did a whole project on that last year. How could you not remember? You really will never find a job if you keep doing so terribly in job interviews.
</p>
<p>You’re sitting there ruminating when you’re meant to take your partner shopping. But how can you now, when you can’t bear to leave the house? You don’t want to face the real world.
</p>
<p>This is when you might snap at your partner. They ask how you are. And, in theory, you could have been nice to them. Apparently being nice costs nothing. But in this moment, it feels beyond your capability. You have no energy left to formulate any kindness.
</p>
<p>At least snapping means the conversation is over. And they leave you alone for the rest of the night. It’s not that you don’t care about them. You do love them. Your brain’s just doing its best. It only has limited energy.
</p>
<p>Sometimes these mountains can last for seconds. Sometimes it’s weeks. We can be trapped in our thoughts. Unable to get away from them. And, yes, we can distract ourselves. We can block everything out. Shrink it temporarily. But the mountain is still there. Just below our awareness. Vulnerable to any little knocks that might trigger it. Restoring it to its natural height.
</p>
<p>Our current energy level is represented by our height in the landscape. And while our mountains might tower over us, reaching far up into the sky—our energy limit is often much lower. It’s an altitude we cannot climb above. Understanding this helps us see that we're not lazy or mean. We're just working within our limited energy budget.
</p>
<h2>Planning</h2>
<p>Over time, we learn to anticipate the height of this energy limit. We learn which paths are dangerous and would take us up to it. We also learn to watch out for the fluctuations: the risks we absolutely need to avoid, the events we shouldn’t go to, and the conversations we should never have. We think if we can plan ahead, then hopefully the dangerous fluctuations will never get the chance to happen.
</p>
<p>And normally, we do well at this. We look out at our landscape and contemplate our paths. We map them out thoroughly and decide with a clear head. We can see some risks aren't worth taking, no matter how big the reward might be. We can also see the times the reward might be that little bit too tempting to ignore.
</p>
<p>But some paths feel scary—we don't want to look at them or even acknowledge they exist—like that exam next week, or that hospital appointment we’re avoiding making. And this gets even harder when we’re stressed. Planning our way out can become impossible. It’s like a mountain fog blocks the paths we could have taken so we can’t even see them anymore.
</p>
<p>Your dad died 6 months ago. And it still feels awful. On top of that, you hate your job. Two huge mountains have intersected beneath your feet, holding you up at your energy limit.
</p>
<p>Every day feels endless. There really is no end in sight. You don’t know how you can even begin to feel better. So you’re just surviving. Trying to get through the next five minutes. High up on these mountains, right at your limit.
</p>
<p>You’ve managed to carve yourself a little pocket. In bed at 10 am. Where you can just about breathe. Barely. But it still feels like relief. You’re hiding in there. Just for a moment. But all around you. In every direction, the landscape rises up. You’re trying your best not to look. To keep the mountains out of your mind. All the paths go up beyond your energy limit. And every task feels beyond your capabilities.
</p>
<p>Making a coffee is too much. Replying to a message is too much. Getting out of bed is too much. You’re completely overwhelmed all the time. It’s uncomfortable to think about all these tasks. To even glance at their paths. You just want to stay in your pocket. And forget the world exists. It’s the only way to temporarily quieten the mountains.
</p>
<p>And if you can’t even make a coffee, how can you plan your way down? You feel absolutely trapped. You can’t face thinking about anything at all. And you literally cannot even see the paths out—even if other people point them out. They stay purely theoretical. Not things you could actually do.
</p>
<p>Or maybe you're someone else entirely.
</p>
<p>You have to make a presentation for a course. The path is obvious. Just start working. But every time you try to think about it, it feels too much. You immediately get stressed. Actually opening the laptop and starting on it? Well, that’s impossible.
</p>
<p>You know the consequences. You just can’t make yourself do it. You know it’s procrastination. But what can you do? You always leave it to the last minute. But somehow it just seems to work.
</p>
<p>The days creep by. And lo and behold, suddenly, the day before it’s due, you feel the focus coming. Just like you knew it would. A new mountain is rising quickly beneath your feet. You start to feel the inevitable stress of not finishing on time. And suddenly the consequences feel very real. You will fail your course if you don’t start right now. Right at this very moment. So quick, get the laptop, and get on that path.
</p>
<p>That mountain you felt about starting is now eclipsed by a bigger, much more imposing mountain. This one represents failing your course. It’s taking you up high, right up to your energy limit. But it doesn’t feel like panic. No, it feels like focus. It’s shutting down all your other thoughts. You’re entering fight or flight. All just to create a presentation.
</p>
<p>We’re always making decisions based on our landscape and its pathways. When we’re stressed our options are limited. But when we’re at lower altitudes, we have the excess mental energy to see into the distance and plan the paths for next week. Or even next year. We have the spare energy to take risks, hoping to discover new pathways down to the valleys.
</p>
<h2>Emotions</h2>
<p>Our emotions act like our sat nav. They help create our own internal representation of reality. They tell us about our terrain: the lay of the land, our current height, the steepness of our gradient, and whether we’re heading in the right direction—towards our valleys—the direction that makes survival more likely.
</p>
<p>But they don’t just guide us down the pathways. They’re also continuously giving us new data. And we use this to reshape our map: marking out new mountains and valleys, and more accurately plotting our existing ones. Our emotions tell us which paths to reinforce, and which paths to avoid as they are likely to lead to catastrophic mistakes.
</p>
<h3>The New Relationship Landscape</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that new relationship feeling. When you feel happy, blissful even. The world feels new and full of fresh opportunities. Maybe last week it was hard to get out of bed. But now everything has a purpose. Your whole landscape has shifted. You're rolling down to a new valley you’ve never been to before. And suddenly everything looks different, much brighter. You feel like a whole new person.
</p>
<p>And it continues. Day after day. You feel the rush of energy as you keep rolling down the slopes. Gaining momentum. You can’t stop. Even if you wanted to. And there’s no way that you want to.
</p>
<p>Your old problems don’t seem important anymore. Your work day is as dull as ever. But it’s ok. Your mind is just fantasising about tonight. You can already picture telling your partner about a colleague's dodgy look. You know they’ll love that story. You can hear them laughing, joking about how they really need to get a life and stop being obsessed with you.
</p>
<p>Having someone reliably there changes everything: someone to trust, to validate your experiences, and to share your life with. It gives you a whole new sense of safety and security.
</p>
<p>Over time, this lower energy state starts to feel normal. It’s your new baseline. A new stability. This new landscape is not perfect—it has mountains too—but they feel different. You have so much more free energy. For the first time you feel ready to handle bigger consequences. You can take bigger risks, maybe make big life changes. Maybe you feel more able to stand up for yourself—like you finally found the strength to stop talking to your emotionally abusive father. Once and for all. You feel like you can finally breathe.
</p>
<p>But unfortunately, life also has heartbreaks. Maybe your partner calls things off. Fuck.
</p>
<p>Suddenly, all their glorious downwards slopes start to evaporate. And you feel a deep sadness. A mourning of the paths that used to be. The echoes of the fading gravity that no longer brings you home. You feel lost. You are literally lost. You have no idea which direction to head. Your baseline height has risen. And all the visible routes around you feel empty and unfamiliar.
</p>
<p>To make matters worse your dad calls when you're feeling particularly sad. You really don’t feel up to this today. He says he knew you would never be able to hold on to your ex. They were too good for you. What a mess. He was rude to you. And you just took it. Like the old days. Why did you let him say that to you? Why did you not stand up for yourself?
</p>
<h3>North Star</h3>
<p>Sometimes in life we might feel a quiet voice. A whisper of happiness calling out from below the mountains. Calling us to the valleys. From beneath the turbulence of the everyday fluctuations. It's in a moment that feels right. A feeling that this is exactly how it's meant to be. It’s our north star. Our compass.
</p>
<p>Let’s take the moment we finally realise we love someone.
</p>
<p>Like we always knew we were fond of them. That we liked spending time with them. Sometimes we even vaguely wondered why we wanted to be around them so much. Why our eyes kept catching theirs. Why we liked their silly jokes or their awkward grin. And then all of a sudden we know. And it feels like it's always been true. It's always been there. Under the surface of the daily noise. A bigger, deeper truth. That we’re absolutely in love with them.
</p>
<p>So now we know. And we can see that all our paths have been slowly and silently, but very surely, orientating towards them.
</p>
<h2>Emotional Processing</h2>
<p>When we have a stressful moment—a major emotional experience—we often don’t have the spare energy to process our emotions there and then. So we cordon them off. Tag them to come back to later. Maybe in our sleep, or at a time in our lives when we feel more safe. At that point, we can start to sift through what happened, to fully process the emotions and properly map out the new terrain.
</p>
<p>The more dangerous and stressful the experience, the taller the mountain. And the more we need to protect ourselves from traversing it again. So the larger the area we seal off with barriers and no go warning signs.
</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at this character’s landscape.
</p>
<p>You just saw your ex with their new partner in the park. A huge mountain formed. Right over the top of that park. You said to yourself you’re never ever gonna go there again.
</p>
<p>But then later that evening, your mind drifts. You can feel the emotions coming back. You really just hate them. They broke your heart.
</p>
<p>But wait a minute. Actually. Now you’re thinking about it. It doesn’t feel as bad as you thought. The breakup was 8 months ago. And you had that really nice first date last week. Maybe you could risk the park. Oh no. That still hurts. You definitely can’t. But still, it’s good to notice you’ve made a small amount of progress. Maybe one day you’ll be ok.
</p>
<h3>Everyday Overload</h3>
<p>But processing means going back to feel that emotion that was too much—all over again. And that takes energy. A lot of energy if the experience was stressful. And when you're at your limit, that’s energy you just don't have.
</p>
<p>Imagine you're having a fight with your partner. They keep going on. Point after point. Each one a new thing you've done wrong. A new defense you have to form. It's exhausting mental gymnastics. You don't know what’s coming next. What to protect against. Eventually your brain becomes overloaded. It can't think anymore. And you just need it all to end.
</p>
<p>So you snap. Say it’s too much. That you need some space. But they don't listen. They keep going on. So you shut down. You can't even hear them anymore. They’re just noise. Deafening noise. It’s all too much to bear. Inside you’re just begging for them to stop.
</p>
<p>The next day they say they’re sorry. They want to talk it over. But you can't. You’ve blocked it out. Blocked it off with warning barriers. You want to move on and forget about the whole thing. Pretend it never happened. It doesn’t feel safe to go there again.
</p>
<p>Those barriers might stay up forever. Marking the unmapped terrain. Or maybe something might help you process it: a later discussion, or a weirdly helpful argument the next week. Or maybe—over time—it just fades into the background of your landscape. A distant mountain mixed up with all the other similar arguments.
</p>
<h3>Trauma</h3>
<p>But some experiences are bigger. They’re too profound. Too monumental to fade. Instead they become defining features in our landscape.
</p>
<p>You’re a child. You just fell over, and you’ve really hurt your leg. So you start to cry. Then your mum shouts at you for exaggerating. But you’re not. You can barely walk. Your mum's stressed. She has an important meeting at work, and she’s running late taking you to school. It’s her fault though. She lost the house keys. But anyway. She does try. She’s just very stressed.
</p>
<p>You try to walk. But oh my god does it hurt. You keep going. But you're limping along very slowly. You can tell your mum is annoyed. She stares you straight in the eyes and tells you, "We don't have time for this. Get yourself together. Why can't you just be normal for once? Sometimes I wish I'd never had children" Now, that one really, really does hurt. Ouch.
</p>
<p>You fall to the floor in a ball. You can barely breathe. You feel so upset. So so upset. But now your mum is even more annoyed. She needs to get to work. And so she drags you up by your arm.
</p>
<p>So there you are, getting dragged along. You’re still upset. But you have no choice. Sitting on the floor feeling sorry for yourself made it worse. So you have no choice but to keep going. But now you’re more detached. You're thinking about what you can do to make this ok. Crying doesn’t help. Feeling sorry for yourself doesn’t help. You just need to shut off these emotions somehow. Stop listening to them. They’re not doing you any good. She treats you worse when she can see your emotions.
</p>
<p>There’s no one around to help you feel safe. No one to tell you it wasn’t your fault. So you cry alone in bed that night. Blaming yourself, if only you could be a better child, then this wouldn’t have happened.
</p>
<h2>Living at High Altitude</h2>
<p>Everyone’s landscape is unique. For some, it’s mostly small hills. In daily life they’re lucky enough to barely reach their energy limit. They might have some challenging climbs, but as long as they’ve packed their walking boots and extra fluids, they’ll be fine.
</p>
<p>For others, their landscape is a series of complex, interlocking mountain ranges. They have their own Himalayas. A landscape full of dense mountains, and raised pathways. Creating a high baseline energy. A lifetime of memories that took them far above their energy limit. Adding new ridges and sub peaks. And far reaching foothills. They live their whole life at a high altitude. Always vigilant, always anxious, because every potential fluctuation is dangerous. It could instantly send them right up to the peak of their Everest. Far, far above their energy limit.
</p>
