<h2>Erosion</h2>
<p>The drive to understand and map our mountains can lead to their softening. The slow dissipation of their power. Replacing our raised structures to pathways that overlay onto the real terrain.
</p>
<h3>Time</h3>
<p>They say time heals all. And when our life moves on, leaving these regions of pathways far away and isolated from our current life that is true. Even when we go back and look at these paths, their anxious energy remains distant and cut off from our current life. They are effectively defused.
</p>
<p>Think about your worst break up. How you didn’t think you’d ever recover. Life didn’t feel like living anymore. You were sure you would never love like that again.
</p>
<p>But now. Looking back. 10 years later. The memory is distant. In fact, it’s a bit absurd. It might as well have been someone else’s life. You can see it very clearly now. They were never right for you.
</p>
<p>But at the time, it was devastating. You cringe thinking about it. How you tried to be friends. Even though it broke you. Pretending to be happy for them when they got a new partner. It’s embarrassing to think about.
</p>
<p>Back then. Your whole landscape was shaped around them. Every path rolled down towards them. The gravity of your old life kept pulling you back. Only to feel the thud. The thud of them caring less. The thud of them moving on. Every path you took to reach them, led to them walking further away.
</p>
<p>You remember the song you played on repeat. The one that spoke directly to your broken heart. It’s funny to think about now. You also remember your friends' endless patience. The times you cried together over a rom-com. The way their wisdom helped you see the flaws in the relationship more clearly.
</p>
<p>And then you remember the day you bumped into them in the street. A few years later. You were genuinely pleased to see them. You said hello. Asked how they were. And then just carried on with your life.
</p>
<h3>Processing</h3>
<p>Healing from our core beliefs is harder. They’re often a whole interconnected mountain range. One we’ve spent a lifetime building detours around. And these bypasses are deep and well worn. So we rarely feel brave enough to take the sharp turn and move towards it head on.
</p>
<p>But sometimes we can. Sometimes we take that dusty single lane road. And start the hard, and scary task of processing the pain of our past. Fully mapping the landscape for the first time.
</p>
<p>A therapist can give you some of the validation you never got as a child. They might say things like, "Yes, what happened to you was bad" or "You did well to survive that." And for the first time—it feels safe to think maybe it wasn't your fault. Maybe these things weren’t failings in you. Maybe what happened was enough to harm anyone. Maybe you're not actually broken. And maybe. Just maybe. You can heal.
</p>
<p>So, slowly you test them. Do they really accept you? Or are they being nice because they're paid? Can you actually trust them with your deepest fears?
</p>
<p>You imagine telling them. But then you also imagine seeing the truth in their face. Their flinch. Their awkwardness. And then you imagine their lie. Having to pretend you’re normal. That your behaviour wasn’t that bad. Because that's their job. They have to tell you they accept you.
</p>
<p>But if a therapist can’t accept you—you know that no one can. So you can’t take any risk on this.
</p>
<p>Over time, you slowly circle closer and closer. They seem to like you. Enjoy your company. Maybe you should trust them with the truth. But actually. What is the truth? You don’t even know the truth. All you have is a tangled web of memories, and feelings you were told were wrong. You can’t actually tell them any truth. You can’t find it yourself.
</p>
<p>Together you work through things. You process some painful memories. Gain some new understanding. Then suddenly, it hits you both. You believe love is something you have to earn. But you can never be good enough to earn it. That’s it. That’s the rule you’ve been living your whole life around.
</p>
<p>You knew it on some level. That mountain was always there. But now you’ve mapped it. You feel relieved. You can see you've been treating relationships like a job interview. Trying to prove to them, and to yourself that you’re valuable.
</p>
<p>You're not cured. The mountain is still there. But for the first time, you can see it. You can look at it. And it’s ludicrous. Everyone deserves love. You know you can’t make someone love you by doing tasks for them.
</p>
<p>In reality. You’ve been controlling them. While hiding yourself. You’ve never given anyone the autonomy to love you for you. You’ve never allowed them to start to erode your mountains.
</p>
<h3>Insights</h3>
<p>While the processing might have helped heal. Insights can’t heal alone. When you have that moment of things clicking into place. The “aha”. You’ve realised something. You’ve found a true path on your landscape. But there is still work to integrate the landscape around it. It’s just given you some stable ground to stand on. A new base to help you explore from. Take some orienteering  expeditions into the mountains from.
</p>
<p>Maybe you’re reading a framework on human behaviour. And the author is presenting case study after case study. They kind of feel true, but you can’t relate to the exact characters. It’s all been feeling slightly blurry. Then you have a hard day at work. You feel exhausted. You realise you’re out of energy. The feeling the framework is describing. But you don’t want to lie on the sofa. You want to forget the world exists. Not think about anything at all. That’s the same. But the dance floor is calling out to you, not the sofa. Something clicks inside. You can suddenly connect it to your own landscape for the first time. Next time you do something out of character you can start to understand why.
</p>
<h3>Counter Evidence</h3>
<p>When we are feeling brave. When we are feeling safe. We can tentatively try out the mountain paths. Gain some real life evidence to map the real terrain.
</p>
<p>Imagine you’re dating someone new. And you have a core belief that you’re too much.
</p>
<p>It’s date seven now. They seem to like you. It’s nice. You’re still in the honeymoon period. Free falling down the slopes. Ecstatically happy. All your paths are aligning towards them. Towards their gravity. And it’s starting to feel like fate. Meant to be. Like meeting them was inevitable.
</p>
<p>And it feels blissful. You’re not affected by any of your normal triggers. Your brain is happily taking risks and creating new neural pathways.
</p>
<p>Take last week, for example. You casually mentioned that it hurt when they didn't kiss you goodbye. You braced yourself for a fight. But then… then, they just said they were sorry. They were in a rush. They felt bad. Then. Then the next time they left, they went out of their way to make you feel special.
</p>
<p>That’s not how it's supposed to work. People are supposed to get defensive. To call you needy. To hurt you back. But it seems like... well. Maybe... Maybe... this person doesn't actually... Um... Think you are too much.
</p>
<p>And with every kind word. Every promise kept. Every new mark on the scorecard. They’re slowly rewriting your landscape.
</p>
<p>Then, the next week. Your mum calls. She makes a seemingly harmless comment. “Oh dear. You’re upset still. You're so sensitive. Your sister doesn’t get upset like you do.”
</p>
<p>You know it's just how she is. She didn't mean it how you took it. But it still knocks you. Why is she always like this?
</p>
<p>A lot of people have worse childhoods. You shouldn’t let it affect you so much. You must be weak. Sticks and stones and all that. Your mum just has a knack of making you feel worthless, like… like you were the consolation prize child. And it really gets to you. Even though you know it shouldn’t.
</p>
<p>Later your partner comes round. They can see you’re upset. It feels embarrassing. You don’t want to tell them. You’re overreacting. It’s only a little thing. And you know how people normally react.
</p>
<p>Normally they’re dismissive. They say things like "All parents damage their kids." or “Oh my mum was like that too”. Which is just the polite way of saying your pain doesn't count. This isn’t big enough to matter. You should have got over it a long time ago.
</p>
<p>Your partner really wants to know though. They’re pushing you. So you take the risk. And they listen. Weird. But suddenly you realise three hours have passed. And they’re still there. Still listening. You feel something you’ve never felt before. Validation. Security. Like maybe your mum’s words were cruel. And maybe it’s ok to think that.
</p>
<p>Maybe, just maybe your emotions are valid. Maybe you aren't too much. Maybe people don’t leave when they know you better. Maybe sometimes you are emotional. Sometimes you do cry. But maybe that’s ok. Maybe people will love you anyway.
</p>
<h3>Resolving Friction</h3>
<p>But inevitably one day. When you’re both stressed. And you both have other things on your mind. You have an argument. And it’s a big one. Your partner was supposed to meet your parents, but they cancelled at the last minute. Said they had to work. It feels suspicious. You're not sure you believe them.
</p>
<p>That evening you try to talk to them. But they aren’t listening. You’re feeling unheard and dismissed. You don’t know what to do. They don’t seem to be able to hear you. In your frustration you tell them they’re selfish. They storm off and won’t answer your calls. It all feels so sudden. So out of character.
</p>
<p>But it turns out your mountains directly oppose each other. Your “I’m too much” has collided with their “I’m not enough”. By trying to get down your mountain, you pushed them up theirs. And then their structure showed up.
</p>
<p>Solving these patterns is where the hard work begins. Years of trial and error. Cycles of hurt and healing. Hoping that somehow you’re circling towards each other rather than away. This is where the real erosion happens. Where we slowly learn to relax our structures. And unfortunately, there are no easy answers.
</p>
<h3>Opposing Mountains</h3>
<p>But to heal our mountains. We have to circle their bases. Sometimes take their dangerous paths. Because that’s what enables us to forge new routes. Map the accurate reality. Smash up the rigid rules of our lens and protective structure and start building pathways closer to the terrain.
</p>
<p>That’s why our biggest healing often happens through meeting our opposite. The person who naturally finds it hard to give what we seek to heal.
</p>
<p>Anxious meets avoidant. Unworthy meets incapable. Controlling meets submissive.
</p>
<p>And it can be a gift or a curse. Or both depending on the relationship.
</p>
<p>But true, deep healing comes from acceptance. From someone seeing the beautiful, messed up human being we are. And loving us anyway. And from that person caring enough. Being driven enough. To overcome their own mountains. Just to love us that little bit better.
</p>
<h2>Holding Patterns</h2>
<p>But erosion is hard. It comes from taking risks. And unfortunately, a lot of these will fail. So sometimes we just take the option of the easy life. Live in our protective structure. Take the easy paths. Because we are doing ok. We’re stable. We’re not getting too hurt. A little bit hurt, but it’s not too bad. It’s a familiar hurt. These are our holding patterns.
</p>
<h3>Careful Distance</h3>
<p>Your partner forgot to take the bin out. Yet again. It riles you up a little bit. Not enough to start a real fight. But you still can’t help but make a sarcastic comment. “I’ll take the bins out myself then shall I?”. They look at you. They know exactly what you meant. So they answer you back. “Well, I did walk the dog twice today. How many times did you do it?”
</p>
<p>You want to say more. But you know it’s best to leave it. You said your piece. Made your point the only way you know how. Neither of you have ever worked out how to do this. How to feel heard in this situation. Nothing you’ve tried has ever worked.
</p>
<p>You could tell the truth. That it hit your insecurities. But that would knock, and trigger their mountain. About not being good enough. They would get defensive. Which would’ve sent you further into your own protective structure. Then it would have carried on escalating.
</p>
<p>You both know the game. And the moves by now.
</p>
<p>Over time you’re drifting further apart. You still love them. But they feel so far away sometimes. You’ve forgot how to be yourselves.
</p>
<h3>Oscillating Closeness</h3>
<p>Some couples find stability through intense cycles.
</p>
<p>You’re very, very deeply in love. So is your partner. But you can’t seem to make it work. You seem to constantly trigger each other. So your relationship has become a battle ground. Sometimes you can’t help but think. Maybe it’s just a trauma bond these days.
</p>
<p>After a particularly bad argument you break up. Again. Maybe you have to finally accept they aren’t the one for you. Because you just can’t find any way to make this work. You wish you could. But it’s too hard. You can’t keep living like this.
</p>
<p>You spend some time apart. It hurts. You just want to call them. Get back together. All your paths still lead to them. But you can’t take the pain of the relationship anymore. So instead, you’re living in a daze. Trying to find new paths. Putting yourself out there. Maybe if you force yourself to keep going. The right pathway will appear. The one that will finally lead you away from all this pain.
</p>
<p>But then a video comes up on tiktok. About love. About how hard it is. But that it’s worth it. You’ve been so unhappy without them. Maybe the video is right. Love is worth it. You don’t want to get hurt again. But you miss them. Later that night you text them casually. You just want to know if they are still there.
</p>
<p>Before you know it, you’re back together. Rolling down those hills all over again. The furrowed grooves of descent carved deep into the landscape by now. The gravity makes it feel right. Somehow even better than that first time. Like it’s just meant to be. It was silly to think you could ever live without them.
</p>
<p>You’ve tried so many different things. Through the multiple breakups. Maybe you’ve tried dating others. You’ve tried focusing on work. You’ve tried to find yourself. But in the end. All these new paths just cycle back round. They always lead to this person. The one who can always give you that instant rush. The intensity of falling into the valleys bound together.
</p>
<p>Maybe this is true love trying to find a way. Maybe it’s just dysfunction. You just don’t know. It would be easier if someone just told you.
</p>
<h2>False Erosion</h2>
<p>It’s not just relationships we lie to ourselves about.
</p>
<p>As we start to do the hard work of improving ourselves. Becoming self aware. Becoming accountable. We learn the correct labels. Toxic. Abusive. Maladaptive. And suddenly, our old structures become too shameful to defend. They have become their own mountains.
</p>
<p>But the brain is a master of avoidance. So what are we going to do? Are we going to heal? Or will we just build a brand new, more sophisticated bypass?
</p>
<p>So of course, we build the bypass. And this one has higher, more sturdy walls. Built confidently with bricks labelled healthy and healing. Passed to us by others, and by society. And we feel justified and superior. Like we have finally got it right.
</p>
<p>But in reality. All we’ve done is built an expansion to our structure. We’ve just got better at hiding it. And more confident at enacting it. But ironically, it’s just diverted us even further away from the true messy negotiation of healing.
</p>
<h4>Asking for what you Need</h4>
<p>You’ve read the books. Been to therapy. Done the work. Learnt to be brave and communicate your needs. Even if this isn’t always well received. You’re doing what is right for you.
</p>
<p>So it’s friday night. Your partner wants to go out with their friends. You can feel your fear of abandonment creeping in. But that’s ok. You understand what to do. You just need to name it. You say to your partner. “I’m feeling really anxious about you going out. Can we just talk through my feelings first? Then you can go out.”
</p>
<p>You feel mature. Like you’re finally growing. Learning to take up some space. You’ve learnt to name your anxiety. And how it connects to your childhood wounds. And right now you just need some reassurance. It’s asking for what you need. Exactly what you’re meant to do.
</p>
<p>So they sit and talk to you. But by the time you feel calm. They say it’s too late to go out now. That they can’t be bothered. And they do seem a bit frustrated. You can understand that. But you’re their partner. They should want to support you. And there’s an extra bonus for both of you. You’re being vulnerable. Surely that should bring you closer together.
</p>
<p>But what you don’t realise. Is that all of this is not as it seems. It’s just a new, more enlightened form of control.
</p>
<h4>Being Transparent</h4>
<p>Maybe you’ve completely mapped out your own patterns. You’ve learnt to accept you’re flawed. And that’s ok. It’s taken a huge amount of work.
</p>
<p>You meet someone new. And it's only fair you tell them about yourself up front. "I have anxiety issues. Sometimes I need extra support. If this is too much for you, I understand". You're being clear aren't you? You need someone who can handle you. This way you know the relationship works for both of you. Before you get too invested.
</p>
<p>On your 5th date. Their mum calls. They look stressed. They say “I’m sorry this is really important. I need to go. I’m so sorry.” You don’t like it. If it’s not their mum, it's their best friend. Or their niece. There’s always someone more important than you.
</p>
<p>You just want to feel important to your partner. It’s a familiar hurt. Because it reminds you of your emotionally distant mother always prioritising your sister.
</p>
<p>So it’s time to stand your ground isn’t it. If they can’t prioritise you now when will they ever be able to? You are clear. You are boundaried. “I told you this up front. You knew what you were getting into. But if I am too much for you. We’d just better end it now”.
</p>
<p>Now they are trapped between a rock and a hard place. Your upfront declaration has worked. You are safe. But they are silenced. The relationship now runs on your terms.
</p>
<h4>Taking Space</h4>
<p>You know all about codependence. You’ve been there. Bought the t-shirt. And you know it’s not healthy.
</p>
<p>Partners in the past always expected too much. For you to take care of their emotions. To come running whenever they called. They had issues. They needed to learn some independence. They always wanted to change you. Never again.
</p>
<p>So you’ve told your new partner that sometimes you need space. Sometimes you get overwhelmed and just need some time to yourself. They seemed to accept it. They said they understood. They came across as reasonable at the time.
</p>
<p>But then, in an argument. They bring it up. Hold it against you. And it triggers something in you. You’re really trying to be a good partner in this relationship. But sometimes you push yourself way beyond your comfort level. For their sake. And they just don’t seem to get it. They don’t appreciate your efforts.
</p>
<p>Sometimes they message you too much. You force yourself to reply, just so you don’t hurt their feelings. Sometimes they want to cuddle too much. You do it. Even though it’s uncomfortable. You don’t want to hurt their feelings. But it feels smothering.
</p>
<p>Can they not see how hard you are trying? It’s exhausting. You just need some space before you blow. This is for their sake too. You don’t want to hurt them. They need to understand you cannot meet all their needs. They’re becoming codependent. And it’s not healthy.
</p>
<p>You start carving out a bit more space. You’re not trying to be mean. You want this relationship to work. But you also want it to be healthy. But they sense the distance. Even though you’ve been so careful to hide it. You don’t want to hurt their feelings. But this is just more evidence. They’re too focused on you. They need to focus on themselves. On their own life.
</p>
<p>Next time you see them. They try to bring it up. You shut it down. “Healthy relationships require space. Maybe you should see a therapist about why you need so much external validation”. You mean it. You really do want this relationship to work. That’s why you need them to be healthier. Anyone would feel suffocated with what they are asking for.
</p>
<p>Your core belief. That you aren’t capable of intimate relationships has turned into a hard boundary. A rule your partner has no choice, but to learn to follow. Neither of you are healing. Just avoiding.
</p>
<h4>Triggered</h4>
<p>Maybe you grew up with the core belief that your true self is not important. That your voice doesn't matter. That you have no power to keep yourself safe.
</p>
<p>And it keeps happening in life. People keep hurting you by being themselves. By living their life. They forget to notice you. Forget to validate your identity. Forget to get your specific gender and sexual orientation right. Forget to understand the deep nuances of your personality. Maybe they talk about their own trauma without making you the star.
</p>
<p>But you’re an adult now. You’re not weak anymore. You’re powerful. You have the power to stand up for yourself. And so you do. And you have the perfect words to enforce it. "You’ve triggered me". And then the quiet after thought to yourself. I am ok. I am finally big enough to be heard. To be seen. To take up space.
</p>
<p>But in your need to create space for your protective structure. You’ve removed any space for true connections.
</p>
<h4>Being Understanding</h4>
<p>Even being the understanding, accommodating partner can be a form of avoidance. Maybe you believe you’re unworthy of true love. You think you can only be accepted if you hide parts of yourself. That no one could accommodate all of your needs.
</p>
<p>And maybe your partner has a core belief of their own. That they are unable to love fully. That some part of them is broken. But you can see them clearly. You understand them. It’s not their fault. They’re doing their best. It’s just their trauma, their upbringing, their insecurities speaking. So you are always accommodating towards them. Because you understand.
</p>
<p>But this understanding comes at a cost. It’s strengthening your own mountains. It's confirming that there are parts of you that need to be hidden away.
</p>
<p>And you aren't helping with their mountains either. They can see they’re hurting you. That you’re trying desperately to be ok. When you’re not. So they’re learning a lesson of their own. For them to be loved, their partner must be in pain. That loving them means coping with their inadequacies. And that just confirms their deepest fear. That some part of them is broken.
</p>
<h4>Wrong Mountains</h4>
<p>Maybe you think you know your mountains. But actually you haven't gone deep enough.
</p>
<p>You think you know the problem. People don’t listen to you. It happens all the time. And it feels horrible. Hard to sit with. So this must be the mountain. Your core belief must be “I don’t deserve to be heard.” And it all makes perfect sense.
</p>
<p>It happens everywhere. You tell your partner about your day. And they just scroll on their phone. You share your ideas at work. And people talk over you. Even your friends can’t seem to listen.
</p>
<p>So you decide on a plan. To speak more assertively. To set boundaries about being interrupted. You tell your partner “When you don’t listen to me. It really hurts. I need to feel heard in this relationship”
</p>
<p>But it doesn’t work. Somehow it gets worse. The more you demand attention. The more people stop listening. Your partner says you’re exhausting. That you constantly require validation. That you steer every conversation back to yourself.
</p>
<p>And you’re confused. Aren’t you just asking for basic respect? Just to be heard. How can that be too much?
</p>
<p>But your mountain isn’t “I don’t deserve to be heard”. It’s “I have no worth”. And it’s buried down much, much deeper. Every time someone doesn’t listen. It triggers this core belief. And confirms you are worthless.
</p>
<p>So this new protective structure. A boundary about being heard. It’s just an expansion. Built further away from the mountain base. And when people push back against your boundary. They aren’t just knocking the structure. It’s butting up against your real mountain.
</p>
<p>And the hard truth is. You do exhaust people with your protective structure. You do always steer conversations back to you. But now people’s natural reactions to this hit you exactly where it hurts the most.
</p>
<h3>The Path to True Erosion</h3>
<p>As we've seen, the path to true erosion never runs smooth. And healing isn’t linear. The brain has an amazing ability to misdirect us. Even though it’s also desperate for us to heal.
</p>
<p>This is because our mountains. Our defenses. And our walls. Are the very things that kept us safe. However badly optimised they look from the outside. They were the best solution we had at the time they were created. They were never meant to be our enemies.
</p>
<p>And the more we shame ourselves into healing. Better. Faster, Healthier. The tighter we build our structure. The more rigid the rules we live by. The more controlling we become of the behaviour of others. Because the more we need them to live within our narrow corridors. The more we have to watch out for fluctuations. Anyone of which could throw us out of our structure and onto the mountains.
</p>
<p>This pressure we put upon ourselves will only force us to build new bypasses. Continually mistaking their sophistication for health.
</p>
<p>The only way to get ourselves out of this cycle is to face the fact we are going to mess things up. We will hurt people. We will make catastrophic mistakes, over and over again, even when we think we should be doing better. And this can be incredibly frustrating. Because we all want to do better. For ourselves. And for others.
</p>
<p>But that’s the beauty of being human. It’s nothing to be ashamed of.
</p>
<p>We are all just doing our best. Trying to survive the landscape we found ourselves in. We have no choice but to take the detours. To keep living our lives as best we can. While hoping our decisions help the mountains, and their power over us, slowly erode away.
</p>
<h2>The Onwards Journey</h2>
<p>But how on earth do we do that?
</p>
<p>I’m sure there are times we all wish someone would help us. Just tell us what it is that we should be doing. Which way to go. Where are the shortcuts to the valleys? Or the paths that lead us away from the energy limit. The “Ten Easy Steps to Erode Your Mountains”.
</p>
<p>But that’s exactly what we don’t need. More noise drowning out our own voice.
</p>
<h3>The Noise</h3>
<p>The noise of our past. The noise of what our partner says. What our friends say. What reason says. What our self respect says. What society says. And maybe loudest of all, what our mountains say. Deciphering the best direction to head is almost impossible. Especially when everyone is convinced they have the best map for us. However most of the time they are just telling us the rules of their own structures. Life as seen through their own lens.
</p>
<p>Our true voice is there somewhere though. But it’s so much quieter than all the others. It does not shout or demand you listen. It does not offer strict rules or instructions. It’s more steady. More knowing.
</p>
<p>And we must remember this. Because we can’t prescribe the perfect map for anyone else either. One person’s erosion is another’s sophisticated bypass. We should never judge another person’s landscape, because we can never truly know the height of their mountains, the pain that formed them, and the detours they've been forced to take to survive.
</p>
<h3>Under The Mountains</h3>
<p>We find our own voice in the quiet. The voice of the valleys calling to us. From deep down below the surface chaos. It’s in those moments when we feel absolute certainty. Like there is a sign pointing the direction home. Towards healing. Towards wholeness.
</p>
<p>We can feel it in the good times. In the peace. In our passions. In our love. And we can even feel it when it's hard. When we just had an argument with our partner. When we failed to convince someone of our lives' work. When we got too scared and ran away from an experience. When we got knocked down, but we stand right back up and keep pushing. It’s a sign to keep going. Because this is the right path. And the right path is not always easy.
</p>
<p>And it's a fight. A fight for the courage and safety to finally relax your structure. Maybe put some of its parts away for good. It’s a battle to throw out some of the constraints you live within. Throw out the rules you place on yourself. Throw out the rules you place on others. And someone find the space to show your true self. Build pathways on the landscape itself. Making those mountains less scary. Because you mapped them. Eroded some of their height. And started to exhibit your true self to the world. The one you told yourself is too vulnerable for the real world. Because what if it’s just not true? What if you stopped living in fear? Stopped being scared of what the consequences might be and started just living.
</p>
<p>These moments of clarity give us glimpses of the life we’re chasing. What could be, if we have the resilience to keep forging our own unique path. To keep weathering the storms. To allow our mountains to keep crashing with the mountains of the external world. To create that counter evidence. And to keep going, even when it feels impossible. Even when it feels unfair.
</p>
<p>Once we learn to accept our mountains are part of us. Something we will never be able to stop. And trying to stop ourselves failing. The more we judge ourselves. The tighter we build our structures. The more we try to control others. So instead. We need to see watch what happens when we hit our mountain. And say that was ok. We hurt people. And we got hurt. We didn’t stay in control. But that’s ok. We need to build these paths as close to our real terrain as possible. Not keep building the structured pathways far above it.
</p>
<h3>True Erosion</h3>
<p>My only hope is that this framework offers a new perspective. A little more clarity to help you see your own patterns. And the patterns and actions of others. To connect a few new neural pathways of insight.
</p>
<p>And maybe over time. This frees up a small amount of energy to start taking slightly different paths. And maybe the first set of paths don’t work. And nor does the second. But maybe the 6th set does.
</p>
