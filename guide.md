# Quick Guide

## Energy Landscape
Mental and emotional states exist as a topographical landscape of hills and valleys. Actions requiring effort are represented as upward climbs (mountains), while pleasant or easy experiences are downward slopes (valleys). We navigate this landscape like a ball responding to gravity, naturally drawn toward valleys and requiring energy to climb mountains. Our daily decisions and behaviors follow the path of least resistance through this terrain.

## Fluctuations
Our internal landscape constantly shifts in response to external events and internal states. Small incidents can dramatically reshape our topography - creating instant mountains where flat ground existed moments before. These changes are chaotic and unpredictable, following butterfly effect dynamics. What feels manageable one moment can become overwhelming the next as our landscape reorganizes itself in real-time.

## Energy Limit
We operate within a relatively fixed mental energy budget. When stress pushes us to our energy limits, we lose capacity for anything beyond basic survival. At these peaks, even simple tasks become mountains. Our ability to cope, plan, and respond constructively diminishes as we approach our maximum capacity. This limit explains why we sometimes cannot do things that seem theoretically simple.

## Planning
Our current energy state directly affects our ability to plan and see possibilities. When stressed and at high elevation, we cannot perceive paths that might be obvious when calm. Planning requires spare energy - without it, we're trapped in immediate survival mode. The higher our stress, the shorter our planning horizon becomes, until we can only focus on getting through the next few moments.

## Relationships
Romantic relationships dramatically reshape our landscapes. New love creates deep valleys and momentum, making previous mountains seem smaller. Partners provide alternative paths and shared energy for navigation. However, relationships also create new topography - both smoothing some areas while potentially creating new peaks. The loss of relationships can instantly transform valleys back into mountains, drastically altering our entire terrain.

## Emotions
Emotions serve as our navigation system, signaling the gradient of our current position. They indicate whether we're moving up (stress, anxiety) or down (joy, relief) the landscape. Each emotion provides crucial information about which direction to move. They also reshape the landscape itself, updating our internal map based on experiences and outcomes, making future navigation more accurate.

## Emotional Overload
Processing emotions requires energy. When operating at our limits, we lack the capacity to process new emotional information. Unprocessed emotions don't disappear - they accumulate, creating unstable terrain. This overload often occurs in childhood when we lack resources to handle intense experiences. These unprocessed emotions become embedded in our landscape as permanent features.

## Core Beliefs
Core beliefs are major topographical features formed during intense, often early experiences. They become the mountains we constantly navigate around - "I'm worthless," "I'm a failure," "I'm a burden." These beliefs shape every decision and interaction, though we rarely examine them directly. They're so fundamental to our landscape that we mistake them for objective reality rather than learned patterns.

## Triggers
Triggers are stimuli that instantly transport us up our steepest mountains. They're often connected to core beliefs and can activate disproportionate responses. When triggered, we lose access to our full landscape and become trapped in survival responses. The more mountains in our landscape, the more vigilant we must be, as any small fluctuation could send us rapidly upward.

## Emergency Escape Routes
When stuck on unbearable peaks, we employ emergency strategies to descend quickly, regardless of long-term consequences. These might include emotional suppression, manipulation, dissociation, or destructive behaviors. Developed in childhood as survival mechanisms, these routes provide immediate relief but often create problems. They're activated when we cannot tolerate our current elevation and need immediate escape.

## Protective Structures
We build defensive structures around our biggest mountains to prevent others from triggering them. These appear as rigid rules, boundaries, or behavioral patterns designed to keep us safe from our core wounds. While protective in intent, these structures often manifest as controlling, entitled, or defensive behaviors that create distance in relationships and prevent genuine healing.

## Erosion
Mountains can gradually erode through consistent counter-evidence and safe relationships. Being loved can slowly wear down beliefs about being unlovable. This process requires vulnerability and repeated positive experiences that contradict our core beliefs. Erosion is slow and requires being willing to risk triggering our mountains in order to discover they might not be as solid as we believed.

## Holding Patterns
Relationships often stabilize through patterns that manage but don't resolve underlying mountains. Partners learn to navigate around each other's sensitive terrain, creating elaborate dances of avoidance or controlled conflict. These patterns can create stability but prevent genuine erosion. Couples may cycle through the same conflicts repeatedly, each knowing the moves but unable to change the choreography.

## False Erosion
Sometimes we believe we're healing when we're actually reinforcing our patterns with new strategies. Using therapeutic language to maintain control, setting "boundaries" that are actually protective structures, or intellectually understanding our patterns without embodying change. This false erosion can be more dangerous than honest stagnation because it provides the illusion of growth while deepening our entrenchment.
