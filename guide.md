## Introduction
* Many actions in life can be explained by not having the energy
* When our energy runs out, even simple things can become impossible
* What often looks like laziness or meanness is simply a state of having no energy

## Energy Landscape
* Landscape with mountains and valleys
* Mountains represent difficult tasks, but also simple tasks when we're exhausted
* Valleys are good experiences
* The slope guides our decisions like gravity; we are always pulled downward

## Fluctuations
* Our landscapes change constantly and unpredictably
* Small events can create dramatic changes
* It's chaotic, like the butterfly effect

## Energy Limit
* Our mental energy limit is relatively fixed
* Reaching limits triggers survival mode and focus
* Flight, Fight, Fawn
* What looks like laziness or meanness is often just running out of energy

## Planning
*Stress blocks our ability to see available paths
*When we're on a mountain, paths become invisible even when others point them out

## Relationships
* New relationships can reshape our entire landscape
* Reliable support and trust lowers our baseline energy level
* Breakups can instantly send us back up our mountains

## Emotions
* Emotions are signals showing us the slope
* Positive emotions signal a downward path; negative emotions signal an uphill path
* Each emotional experience updates our landscape
* Emotional processing only happens if we have the energy

## Emotional Overload
* Processing emotions requires energy we don't have at our energy limit
* Overwhelming emotions get put on hold rather than processed

## Core Beliefs
* Extreme childhood moments create lasting mountains
* These mountains shape our daily navigation below our awareness
* Common examples: "I'm worthless," "I'm a failure," "I'm a burden"
* Forced false narratives create fragile cover stories over our true experience

## Triggers
* Multiple mountains create elevated baseline stress
* The steepest downward paths are often hidden behind our core belief mountains
* Different attachment styles reflect different mountain patterns

## Emergency Escape Routes
* Energy limit demands immediate relief
* Childhood survival strategies often continue into adulthood
* Short-term relief wins over long-term thinking
* Often Automatic

## Protective Structures
* We develop defensive structures around our core mountains
* These can appear as entitlement, but represent attempts to avoid pain
* Common structures include scorekeeping, control, and achievement tracking
* These behaviors become automatic

## Erosion
* Mountains can gradually erode through safe experiences
* Counter-evidence and vulnerability enable erosion
* Romantic relationships can provide unique opportunities for healing or harm
* We often attract partners with opposing mountains

## Holding Patterns
* Couples develop stable patterns
* This stability often prevents erosion
* Patterns include careful avoidance or cyclical breakup-reunion dynamics

## False Erosion
* Apparent healing can mask sophisticated avoidance
* Therapy language becomes a tool for control rather than erosion
* Being accommodating or independent can both prevent real erosion
* Understanding mountains intellectually isn't the same as eroding them
