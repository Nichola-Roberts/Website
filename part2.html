<h2>Our Structures</h2>
<p>Our mountains were created to keep us safe. To warn us of danger. And stop us taking paths that threaten our survival. But they’re still perilous to navigate around. They drain our energy every time we approach them so we have little left for planning or foresight.
</p>
<p>So to avoid this cost we engineer our landscape. We build new structures, forged from our intellect—our insights, our logic and our convictions. These structures help us navigate more safely. Instead of confronting the mountain paths directly we construct barricades or bypasses. These new features lead us away from danger, to safer pathways: safer thoughts, safer interpretations, and safer actions.
</p>
<h3>The Barricade</h3>
<p>When our pathways stress us out. When even thinking about them can send us spiralling. We block them off with rules and artificial constraints. Rules like “Don’t check your bank balance”, “I cannot afford to fail”, or “I have to leave because that’s a red flag”. These rules act as barricades around the pathways. Ensuring we don’t have to think about them, or even acknowledge their existence.
</p>
<p>Let’s look again at the example of spotting your ex at the park.
</p>
<p>Maybe you used to go to that park every day. The path was well trodden and reinforced by hundreds of different journeys. It held so much nuanced information: like when the dog walkers came, when the school kids took over, which days had football matches. You knew everything. Nothing could surprise you about the park. Your map was almost level with the terrain—an almost perfect representation of the park's reality.
</p>
<p>Well, until the day you saw your ex. Then all of a sudden none of those details mattered anymore.
</p>
<p>Now every potential journey to the park feels stressful to even think about. The old pathway has become charged with anxiety, its energy cost is now a price you don’t want to pay. So to avoid this you make a new rule. And it’s simple: “Don’t go to the park”. When you wake up tomorrow you won’t have to pay anything. You won’t even have to think about it. There will be no anxious feeling as you weigh up your options. You just have to follow this rule.
</p>
<p>But there’s still a price. Because now you‘re living your whole life around this rule. You probably wouldn’t bump into your ex at the park again. They live on the other side of town. The old, low energy pathway through the park is likely still there—exactly the same. But you don’t take it. The barricade forces you to take a slightly higher energy route every day.
</p>
<h3>The Bypass</h3>
<p>Sometimes even that is not enough. You still know the barricade is there and it’s still in sight. So sometimes we take it a stage further. We built a bypass. The path curves and takes us in a different direction. And it happens so smoothly we don’t even really notice. Things like striving for perfection when we start to feel insecure. The rebound relationship.
</p>
<p>Imagine you just failed an important test at school. The Mountain of "I am Stupid" starts to rise up. It’s painful. So your brain immediately builds a Bypass: "School is for losers anyway."
</p>
<p>You build a new path of the Rebel. You stop trying. You make fun of the people who study. You feel safe. Superior even. But you are walking a path that ensures you never test your intelligence again.
</p>
<p>You built a bypass, a whole system designed to avoid the mountain as much as possible.
</p>
<h3>The Diversion</h3>
<p>Maybe our avoidance is not made for us. Maybe we sense someone’s actions creating a hill, and if left unattended it would slowly get closer and bigger. So we create a diversion. A structure in our landscape that channels their incoming actions, and turns them around and back to safety. Like a deflection when someone criticises us. Gaslighting. Telling someone the actions they need to take to keep us safe. Controlling. Or maybe it’s more defensive.
</p>
<p>Consider the child who was dragged to school. That child had no other options, their survival depended on their mum. They learned their landscape, and in it telling their mum how they felt was a path that only ever made things worse.
</p>
<p>Instead making themselves small kept them safe. It’s backwards, but to be cared for the child had to act like their existence was a burden. Because then, sometimes, on her good days, that allowed their mum to have the energy to care for them. So while it wasn’t a perfectly accurate map of reality, it was the only landscape that worked for them.
</p>
<p>The child created a structure in their landscape that helped channel their mum's actions in a way to keep both of them calmer.
</p>
<h2>Our Core Beliefs</h2>
<p>And this is how core beliefs are formed. Often in childhood. Extreme moments that shape our landscape profoundly. These mountains and their systems of rules will remain for much of our lives.
</p>
<p>In adulthood we are so used to their presence that we barely notice them.
</p>
<p>No. Actually. We do notice them. They’re there in our every action. In our every decision. We navigate our daily lives around them. We just don’t really think about them.
</p>
<p>Because they’re our bypasses. Our mountains. They represent our biggest insecurities. Our deepest fears. They are stressful and painful to think about. So we just don’t. But they are still there. Lurking. They’re the “truths” that we map our daily lives around. The powerful narratives we silently tell ourselves.
</p>
<p>Here are 2 examples.
</p>
<h4>I can't trust anyone</h4>
<p>Maybe one child was hurt time after time. Their dad was violent. Their mum was a drug addict who barely came home. Their grandma punished them for every little thing. Even their teacher just thought they cried too much.
</p>
<p>It was painful every single day. But they couldn’t give up. So, they kept trying new tactics. They thought, maybe if I'm nicer to my grandma, she will be kinder. Maybe if I explain to the teacher, she might understand. But nothing ever seemed to work.
</p>
<p>They kept hoping the next person might be different. But then every new friend eventually just spilled their secrets as gossip. And then stopped talking to them. Every false hope caused the final betrayal to hurt even more.
</p>
<p>So they learnt that vulnerability is a weakness. And that it would always get them hurt.
</p>
<p>As an adult they live by the rule “Never trust anyone”. Reinforced by a mountain range of painful past experiences. So they never truly let anyone in. The rule stops them even considering whether they can let the new person in. And thinking about whether it’s wrong makes them consider the real pathways. The ones that are raised by anxiety.
</p>
<p>They might even reinforce it to themselves. Don’t even think about letting someone in. Because that’s the trick. That’s when you get hurt the most. In a world where you can’t trust anyone. You have to be smart. You have to play the system. Learn to get what you need. Without risking a thing.
</p>
<h4>I’m unstable</h4>
<p>Maybe their parents were inconsistent. One moment they were praised, the next punished. Nothing made sense. But instead of blaming their parents, they internalised it. They learnt not to trust themselves or their own actions. That there was something unstable about them. Something broken.
</p>
<p>So they felt an anxiety about their own existence. Their natural way of being. They created a rule. “Life is only safe when you remain calm” Their only hope was to become better at controlling themselves. . They worked desperately to try to keep the instability contained by controlling the fluctuations of life. But something would always happen to dysregulate them. And therefore, prove their own instability. Reinforcing their core belief. Tightening their belief in the rule. And their resolve in following it.
</p>
<h2>Our Lens</h2>
<p>Our lens is our processor. It takes all the data from the outside world and integrates it into our conscious. We see a mountain in the landscape, and we process it through our lens. We see happiness in the landscape and we process it through our lens. The same with our sadness, our successes our failures. They are all coloured by our lens. The unique, particular flavour that we see running through our landscape. Shaping our goals, our fears, and our motivations.
</p>
<p>Our lens connects a lifetime of memories into themes. One individual event—like a teacher making you stay late in maths class—is just a small hill. But a connecting path is created to another—a failed test when you were 8. And later the pain of getting sacked from a job at 21 is added. Our lens takes these separate events and links them together as foothills, circling the same massive mountain range. A range that tells a powerful story “You aren’t as capable as others”
</p>
<p>Or maybe your lens is built around capability, but around trusting your reality. It connects the memory of your mother believing your sister over you, the teacher who accused you of copying, and the friends who believed your ex's version of the breakup. Each memory reinforces the same devastating rule: “Your perception is wrong, and your reality cannot be trusted”.
</p>
<p>The experiences we remember most clearly aren’t necessarily the most traumatic. They might just have bypasses. The ones we remember likely taught us the clearest message. The motos to live by. “Don’t rely on others”, “People will abandon us”, “We aren’t intelligent", “We aren’t socially capable”. These are our core beliefs.
</p>
<h2>Triggers</h2>
<p>When something hits our anxieties and insecurities, or even our past realities, we feel triggered. We can feel our mountains rising up. Right out of the ground. Beneath our feet. Sometimes out of nowhere. They aren’t always catastrophic though. Sometimes their slope is pretty gentle. They are just a foothill. We can feel our ascent as they form, but we aren’t at our limits, so we can calmly survey the paths and then choose the best way down. It was just a warning to be more careful with our steps.
</p>
<p>But sometimes it’s more like a cliff face. The mountain rises far up into the clouds. Creating an insurmountable peak. Like a firework to a veteran. A child lost at a fairground. Or someone threatening your physical safety. And for someone with the Himalayas—who is already having a bad day—a trigger could be tiny. Like not being able to find the shirt they wanted to wear. It’s only one little thing. But it pushes them right over their energy limit. It could be the last straw that proved, without a doubt, they were incapable, a failure. It showed them they might as well give up on life. Because they will just never be good enough.
</p>
<p>And that’s why it’s hard for others to understand sometimes. Because someone else could be standing there, right next to them, with a stain on their only shirt. Genuinely laughing about their own misfortune. They could even have had a hard day themselves. Maybe their car broke down on their way back from babysitting their five squabbling siblings. But in the end, they are still there, doing fine. They are fortunate enough to have a low baseline altitude, and that day—despite everything—nothing touched their mountains.
</p>
<h3>Triggers Through our Lens</h3>
<p>The raw events of our landscape are colourless. It’s our lens that makes our landscape personal and meaningful. It determines how we interpret our triggers.
</p>
<p>Imagine you get a text from your partner: you forgot to pay a bill and now there’s a late fee. For someone whose lens is relationship harmony, the dread is relational. Their shame isn’t about the task, it’s about letting their partner down. Their first impulse is to make sure the relationship is ok.
</p>
<p>For someone else whose lens is inadequacy, their dread is competency. The shame is about their own failure. Their impulse is not to fix the relationship, but to fix themselves—to create a system to prevent this failure from ever happening again.
</p>
<p>Our lens can understand both of these insecurities. But they may not be your biggest mountains. Your energy limit might be accompanied by a different message.
</p>
<p>As you read this framework you are feeling my lens. And as much as I have tried to make the examples universal they all have a certain colour. The colour of relationships and care. Of emotional needs and abandonment. Because that is the colour that tints my view of my landscape.
</p>
<h3>Bullseye</h3>
<p>A trigger’s power doesn't come from the event itself, but from its ability to hit the bullseye of our core belief. It could be a random moment that proves we are as useless as we always feared, or it could be a comment from someone else, targeting our vulnerability with pinpoint precision.
</p>
<p>Most of the time, we can deflect. We can attribute the feeling to something else, nudge it slightly off target and pretend it didn't just happen. We might feel a flicker of discomfort, but we manage to push it down.
</p>
<p>But then there are the times we can't. The moments when a trigger hits us so perfectly that our silent narrative feels deadly true. There is no other pain like it. It is absolutely unbearable.
</p>
<p>As in, it is really not possible to bear the feeling.
</p>
<h2>Emergency Escape Routes</h2>
<p>So when you’re up a mountain. At your energy limit. And stressed out of your mind. You can’t just sit with it. That would literally be impossible. You can’t casually wait until you calm down. I mean, that’s ludicrous. It’s killing you. You need to get down. Immediately.
</p>
<p>Your brain is in crisis. You have no ability to plan ahead. To consider the longer term consequences. To think through the best path. You just need to take the fastest path down. Right now.
</p>
<p>This is when we use our emergency escape routes. Everyone has their own default reactions. heavily dependent on what worked in childhood. These are the moments of absolute pain. And depending on the paths we choose to take they are the things we are probably the least proud of. The moments that fill us with shame when we look back.
</p>
<h3>Provoke</h3>
<p>You might have learnt the best way to get down your mountain was to push another person up theirs. So they become incapable of triggering you. This could be through attack, provocation or even pleading and begging. Anything designed to destabilise them.
</p>
<p>Imagine your partner is having a go at you. Just because you didn’t want to go to their work event. I mean, fair enough right. No one wants to go to that stuff.
</p>
<p>But now they're going on and on. Listing every little thing they've done for you recently. And honestly, it’s getting boring. They chose to do these things. You didn’t ask them to. And they shouldn’t have done them if they were going to hold them against you.
</p>
<p>As they’re going on. you're barely listening. But then all of a sudden. They hit a target. They strike a nerve. It was probably just luck, but suddenly the boredom's gone. And now they need to stop. So you say something you know will hurt them. Something to take them down from their high horse.
</p>
<p>You say you’re only with them for their money. Then you smile inside. You feel proud. You know that hurt them. Shut them up. And even better than that. Now you don’t feel hurt yourself. Because how could someone so small hurt you? It’s not you that’s flawed. It’s them. And their whole worthless being.
</p>
<p>You get to feel superior for a moment. And it brings a calm. You’ve found your pathway down. It wasn’t pretty, but it was blisteringly fast.
</p>
<h3>Withdraw</h3>
<p>Instead, you might have learnt—that when panic hits—the only way to survive it is by forcing yourself to stay calm. Distract yourself so you can self regulate. Desperately trying to keep a hold of your emotions. Scared of your own potential actions. And the consequences they might lead to.
</p>
<p>So, you learnt to shut down your emotions. Block them out. Ignore them. This could be through compartmentalisation. Or distancing yourself with logical dissection. Or maybe you learnt to straight up distract yourself with exercise, shopping, food, diy, gaming, self harm, or even just endlessly scrolling TikTok. Or maybe you learnt to suppress the feelings directly with drugs and alcohol.
</p>
<h3>Appease</h3>
<p>Maybe you learnt to appease. To try to calm the situation yourself. Take the other person down from their mountains. Hoping they will turn back into that best version of themselves.
</p>
<p>Let’s assume you have a core belief “I can’t handle chaos”
</p>
<p>Your partner had a bad day at work. They come home in an awful mood. This one feels different. You can feel it instantly. Normally you know what they want. How to turn it around. But today you just feel anxiety. You try to say hello. Just hoping for some clues. But they give you none.
</p>
<p>So, you offer a drink. They say no. They want to be left alone. More stress. So, you try something else. Something kind. You tell them you love them. That you missed them today. But it just make it even things worse. Now their anger isn't even about work anymore. It's turning towards you. Your panic rises. But you feel trapped. Nothing is working. You’re running out of ideas.
</p>
<p>Before you even have the chance to think about what to do. Something slips out. You tell them you'll drive the kids to school tomorrow morning after all. Even though your partner has the day off work. Even though you have a very important meeting you can’t miss. They calm down. A little. Not enough to appreciate it. But enough to become predictable again.
</p>
<p>But now you have a brand new problem on your hands. How to excuse yourself from that meeting.
</p>
<h3>Shut Down</h3>
<p>Maybe, instead, in that moment of absolute panic——you’re at a loss. You have nothing to fall back on. No visible paths you could take. You’re core belief is “I can’t handle emotional intensity”
</p>
<p>Imagine your partner has just hurt you. You always feel nervous with conflict. But you try to be brave. You try to bring it up. But that instantly triggers their own mountain of shame. They just start attacking you. Just to get down themselves. You feel angry. Controlled. You want to argue back. You’re desperate to. But it doesn’t feel safe. They’re staring at you waiting for your defence. But you have nothing. Your mind is blank.
</p>
<p>From past experience you can’t fight back. They will just attack you more. You can’t run. They will follow you. You can’t appease. You can’t be that too submissive.
</p>
<p>You’re feeling so stressed you can’t think. You can’t speak. In fact you feel broken inside. Like nothing you could do would be right. And so you do nothing at all. Hoping somehow, anyhow. If you just shut everything out. The moment will pass. And you will survive it. Somehow.
</p>
<h3>The New Mountain</h3>
<p>Everyone has their own strategies. But one thing is always true. When people feel the unbearable, they will do absolutely anything to get down that mountain.
</p>
<p>And these tactics can become their issues. A new connecting mountain range. Your escape strategy becomes its own mountain. You learn “I am dangerous,” or “I’m an alcoholic,” or “I’m too much.”
</p>
<p>So now you’re trapped between two mountains. The one you were running from. And the one you built to get away.
</p>
<p>And people can see this new one. Your escape route. The one that's automatic. It becomes a label. "Controlling," "Alcoholic," "Manipulator." A new mountain of shame. And one that others feel justified pointing out. Right to your face.
</p>
<h2>Protective Structures</h2>
<p>And so yes, on one level, the emergency escape route worked. We got down the unbearable mountain. But it was not pretty. In fact, it was hugely messy and painful. We lost our control. We lost our calm. And we lost ourselves. And it’s probably not something we’re proud of.
</p>
<p>So, next time, given the chance, we catch ourselves before it gets that far. When we feel the anxiety of the impending doom of the mountain approaching, and instead, we engineer a branching path. A new rule. For instance, when our partner's face looks angry, it’s best to say sorry. Or when we sense we’re about to fail, it’s best to pretend we weren’t trying. This means taking a safer, but less authentic route. And in doing so, we lose some of ourselves. But the shame of this inauthenticity saves us from the anxiety. And it saves us from the shame of the emergency escape we avoided taking. And so it seems worth it.
</p>
<p>These pathways are our protective structures. Networks of rules that over time become more interconnected and more intricate. They’re like scaffolding that we build upon our natural landscape. Their energy cost is higher. But it feels worth it for the extra safety we gain. They’re our shield. And now those triggers can’t get through to the real us. The one hiding under the scaffolding. The one we can just about make out through the gaps in the floor.
</p>
<p>And when someone questions or challenges these rules. These structures. We feel justified defending them. Because we’ve analysed the options. And we know this is better than mountains. And, because, we know—that deep down—behind all our defences, and our mountains—everything we’re desperately trying to protect—there lies our most innocent and fragile self. The one that needs looking after the most. So, of course, we’re going to do everything within our power to fight for their safety. Because it’s our duty and our responsibility.
</p>
<h3>The Floorplan</h3>
<p>These structures aren’t built from our weaknesses, but from our strengths. From our intelligence. Our charm. Our wit. Our practicality. I mean, it makes sense. Of course, when faced with our most important task—keeping us safe—we’re going to assign our greatest strengths to it.
</p>
<p>So, when we’re triggered. When we feel that restless anxious energy building within us. Driving us to act. To find that release. Egging us on to the emergency escape. It’s these structures that allow us to take that sneaky sidestep. To take the safer bypass instead.
</p>
<p>They allow us to disperse this anxious energy rattling up the structure’s pathways. The stress, the hurt, the anger—they might all still feel the same. But at least within our structure we know the rules. And we’re the ones in control. No one has imposed anything on us. Because we’ve built it ourselves. We know the locations of the escape ladders. The emergency flares. And the pathways that lead to our favourite features. Like the delicate spiral staircase. The one that allows us to get down flawlessly. Well, as long as we step in exactly the right spots. In exactly the right order. Then we’ll be fine. It might be unsafe. But it’s still a darn sight safer than the mountain.
</p>
<h3>The Watch Tower</h3>
<p>The watch tower is always staffed by the corner of our eye. The back of our mind. The salary paid by the energy of anxiety.  It watches every avenue of our life. But tends to play the closest attention in romantic relationships. So even in the seemingly perfect moments, we’re watching. Is this person still trustworthy? Is this a trick? Can they handle the real me?
</p>
<p>And this is because our own mountains are dangerous enough. Do we really want to deal with someone else’s on top? Do we want to allow someone else’s mountains to tenderly, but also violently, intermingle with our own? Because that’s just asking for trouble. We’re not naive. We know everyone has their own mountains. Their own triggers. But some people are too risky. Too volatile. So, we can’t risk letting their trigger-happy mountains collide with our own.
</p>
<p>So we need to make sure that anyone allowed close is trustworthy. They need to know the laws of our... well, the laws of our protective structure. I nearly said “hearts” there. But it’s not our hearts. We would be crazy to give out the map of our hearts. But the rules of our protective structures—well, they need to know those. And we’re doing them a favour, really. Because to us these rules are the secrets of staying safe. And we want the people we care about to be as safe as we are.
</p>
<p>But, inevitably, one day, our partner will run too fast over the dodgy planks. Or will stay out later than they promised. Or they will know us too intimately. Or blame us for their own failings. Or maybe they won’t pay us back the money they owe us. And in these moments, our watchtower raises the alarm. Increases threat level. And directs us to the next floor up. The situation is critical. And this needs to be corrected. Or we both run the risk of the terrifying mountains.
</p>
<h4>The Scorekeeper</h4>
<p>Let’s take the scenario: your core belief is you’re inadequate. No matter how much you succeed or accumulate—it can never be enough. One bad move could send it all crashing down. You have 2 options: become adequate enough to trust yourself (implausible) or acquire a buffer so large that your inadequacy becomes inconsequential.
</p>
<p>The pressure you place on yourself is immense. You’re chasing that desperate need to feel safe. You wish your partner could share some of the burden. Or at least not make it worse. But they always fail. It’s just not their strength. You can accept that. Mostly. But you just want to breathe a little easier. Not work quite so hard yourself. You can accept they have a passion job. Kind of.
</p>
<p>But on top of that they keep messing up. Keep spending money recklessly. A trinket here. A takeaway there. You would love a partner as stringent as you. You are already compromising a lot. You just wish they could be a little bit more sensible. But they can’t even maintain that. It makes you feel like they don’t take you seriously. And they don’t respect everything you’re striving for. As far as you're concerned—you’re not even just striving for yourself—you’re striving for the both of you.
</p>
<p>You live on constant guard—you try not to be—but you can't help but notice every time they slip up. Every time they go on a splurge. Every time they fail to stick to the rules. And every time they fail, you feel the emptiness. The sadness. They're not being responsible. They take advantage of your competence.
</p>
<p>And each time it happens—a quiet rage builds inside you. A raw indignation at the injustice. Your mind can’t help but start running through the list. The scorecard. And every item triggers a new wave of anger. 7) They didn’t pay their half of the takeaway last week. 8) They’re two days late with their share of the electricity. 9) They haven't done the washing up.
</p>
<p>You’ve counted up the scorecard. And their deficit has gone from teetering to critical. You gave them so many chances. But this has just gone too far. So, you have no choice but to start the ascent to the next threat level.
</p>
<h3>The Test</h3>
<p>The first time they trigger our threat level, we’re sure it must be a mistake. I mean, it has to be. They wouldn’t do something so risky, so reckless, would they? So, we try to explain. “Did you forget we were meant to be careful with money this month?” “Did you notice you’d upset me?” “When you said <em>X</em>, it contradicted <em>Y</em> that you said yesterday” or “Did you just not notice the time?”
</p>
<p>You think to yourself again,  Of course it was a mistake. This person would never hurt us on purpose. They love us. The implications of that would be devastating. That would mean we can’t trust them. That would mean they’re selfish. That would mean maybe we shouldn’t be in this relationship. And, luckily, sometimes we’re right. It was a mistake. And we can breathe a sigh of relief, relax, and take the gentle slope down together—while holding hands and laughing about it.
</p>
<p>But sometimes. Instead. We just get more hurt. We try to explain the situation. The predicament. But they’re so caught up trying to contain their own mountains that it falls on deaf ears. And so, a new wave of hurt and anger forms. And the energy of this is palpable. And hard to contain. It threatens to throw us off our structure and directly onto the mountains. The dangerous, unpredictable, uncontrollable mountains.
</p>
<p>And while we might plan to deliver this test with genuine maturity, compassion and grace. Often we fail, simply because the plan was flawed from the start. It was built from our entitlements. Which always seem to slip out. Our entitlement to their connection, to our own safety, and ultimately, an entitlement to the very structure and rules that created the conflict.
</p>
<h4>The Monitor</h4>
<p>Let’s assume that when you were a child that every decision was made for you. You were taught “I have no autonomy.”
</p>
<p>There were rules for chores. For homework. For when you could see your friends. Rules for your phone, your TV, your music. Rules for what you could wear, what you could say, even what you were allowed to think. It was like your life was something happening to you. Now, as an adult, every compromise hits that same loss of autonomy. Triggering that original wound. The same powerlessness. The feeling that your voice, your wishes, your safety simply doesn't matter enough. And it still hurts. A lot.
</p>
<p>The only way to feel even remotely ok, and in control, is by designing defences that finally create a space for yourself. So, you check your partner’s phone. Because you need to know where they are. Who they’re with. What time they’re coming home. Everything. Not because you don’t trust them. But because their actions impact you. And you will be damned if you let someone have that much control over your life. Again.
</p>
<p>Last time they were out with their brother, they were back an hour late. You remember sitting at home. Waiting. Feeling like your autonomy was slipping away. All over again. So, this time, you explain yourself. Calmly. They’ve obviously just not understood the rules. What you need from them to feel safe. You emphasise how important it is for them to stick to their word. To be courteous. Honourable. And you make sure they are clear on those expectations. This isn't a preference you have. It's a non-negotiable part of a relationship with you. If you can’t trust their word then what can you trust?
</p>
<p>You don’t want to control them. You just want control over your own life.
</p>
<h3>The Last Resort</h3>
<p>If they fail that test, then it’s getting serious. It’s the all-or-nothing stage. We might plead. Coerce. Control. Even tactically withdraw. The goal is to create enough pressure to force them back into line. Back onto the safe pathways of our structure. Which would allow us to finally relax. The crisis would be averted, and we could slowly and carefully climb down the ladders. But, if this fails, then we will have no choice but to take drastic action. And push them away. Punish them. With our last resort. This can look remarkably like the emergency escape routes. However, this is a constructed pathway. It’s more clever. More sophisticated. More insidious. <strong>HOWEVER</strong>, if this one fails, then we truly are left to the mercy of our mountains. And our deepest, truest pain.
</p>
<h4>The Controller</h4>
<p>Here’s a new character. As a child you learnt: “I’m inconsequential". You were neglected. Your parents never had time for you. You only got attention when you were causing trouble. And yes, your parents were angry. But at least in that moment they remembered you existed. You could feel your impact on the world. Your brother was told not to wind you up. To let you play on the console. Even though it wasn’t your turn. It was your little glimpse of what love feels like. What it means to feel important.
</p>
<p>As you got older, you learnt how to become less invisible. You learnt to be so loud that you could never be forgotten: you learnt to create lies, create drama and chaos, as well as how to manoeuvre other people. Because at least then you can ensure you get something back. Something you can’t quite place. But you are sure it must be something slightly like love.
</p>
<p>Sometimes you think there must be another way. Maybe you could get love like everyone else. Because you know what people think of you. That you’re a bad person. You try not to be. You really try not to be. You know that you are not. It’s just sometimes the stress gets too much. Too unbearable. The fear of fading into obscurity all over again. You can feel it right in your core. It’s the worst feeling anyone could imagine. There is nothing worse than being nothing.
</p>
<p>Your partner is out at the pub with her friends. You can feel the anxiety start to build. All the potential scenarios playing out in your mind. She's happy. Having fun. Laughing at you. Probably talking about how you shouted yesterday. And how she's thinking of leaving you.
</p>
<p>You can picture it now. There's someone coming over. They're hitting on her. And she’s weighing up her options. You can just tell what's going to happen. She won’t be coming home tonight. She's gonna be staying with him. Oh wait, actually. You’ve just remembered. It’s even worse. There’s the new guy at work. She thinks his jokes are funny. It drives you mad. He's probably there.
</p>
<p>The thoughts are getting louder. Too much to bear. You don’t want to be this person. This person she might leave. So you try to calm yourself. To think rationally. But it’s not working. It's overwhelming. It will be proof of everything if she leaves. You can’t carry on in this state. What can you do? You have to do something. Anything… <em>She shouldn’t be making you feel this way.</em>
</p>
<p>If she thought enough of you she wouldn’t want you to be this distressed. And ultimately. You are just asking for what you deserve. To be visible. To matter. You should call her and ask her to come home.
</p>
<p>You could ask her nicely. But what if she says no. Last time she said no. It proved how little she prioritises you. You can’t take that risk again. You need a guarantee.
</p>
<p>You pick up the phone. “How dare you go out and flirt with him. Do you not care about me? You need to come home right now. Or I don’t know what I will do.”
</p>
<p>She says ok. Your mountain has gone. She's coming home. None of these imaginary scenarios can happen. Because she will be at home with you. However, she now has a brand new mountain in her landscape. And she can’t go to the pub with her friends anymore.
</p>
<p>Over time your landscape has become manageable. Your life is just that little bit easier. She knows you can’t cope with certain things. So she’s learnt to prioritise you better. Not trigger you so much. You know the truth deep down. That she’s just learnt to walk on eggshells. To preempt the things that might set you off. But that thought is a mountain of its own. You can’t think about it. God knows where following that thought would lead. It’s best to just never go there.
</p>
<p>Now her landscape is full of new mountains. New rules. “I can’t see my friends”; “I can’t stand up for myself”; “I can’t think about my own needs”. You feel calmer. But she feels trapped.
</p>
<h3>The Expansion</h3>
<p>When inevitably our structure fails. We examine the point of failure. Trying to piece together what went wrong. We see the wreckage. The debris. The mess everywhere. We feel shame, and we feel hurt and we feel loss. So we resolve never to let that happen again.
</p>
<p>We take a look at where it failed. Maybe subconsciously. Or maybe, we study it in painstaking detail. Playing it over and over in our mind. Trying to work out what we should have done differently. What new pathways our structure needs to prevent a repeat. Making the solemn vow that we will never let this happen again.
</p>
<p>We add new features, new walkways. Maybe learn new intricate footwork and better balance. Making sure next time we don’t fall for the same tricks. Or next time, we learn to be more understanding. Or next time, we learn not to be so honest. Or so naive. So, the next time someone wants to get close, we will be wiser. And we won’t be making those same mistakes again. But of course this is all filtered through the interpretation of our lens. We are tightening the rules based on our own lens. Thinking it contains the secret to a safe and happy life. But instead we are making it harder for others to live in harmony with. They all have their own structures, and the tighter we build their corridors the less compatible with others we become.
</p>
<p>Over time, the footprint of our structure expands further and further. It eventually stretches far from the mountain it was built to protect. And the reality is, most of us are probably living on our structures the majority of the time. And we don’t even remember most of the reasons why.
</p>
<h4>The People Pleaser</h4>
<p>Let’s look at a person with the core belief "I don't know who I am".
</p>
<p>You're always trying to be yourself. But you can never quite grasp who that is. You know you are nice. You are fun. Charming. Sad. Lonely. Broken. Off. Some sort of mix of all of this. You wish you could place it. This is your existential dread.
</p>
<p>So you're always doing something. Because it feels safe to define yourself by your actions. That's solid. Tangible. You're the person in the friendship group who keeps it going. Organises the events. Buys gifts. Brings people together. You’re indispensable. You know it. They know it. Everyone knows it. But you have to be. Because who are you if you don't make an impact?
</p>
<p>So you compensate. Overcompensate. This way your friends know who you are. You know who you are. Because you’re constantly demonstrating it. Proving it.
</p>
<p>But when your calendar is empty for a week, the anxiety creeps in. Who am I without an audience? Am I a person or just a collection of charming anecdotes?
</p>
<p>Quick let's bake them a cake.
</p>
<h3>The Mask</h3>
<p>We all have a deep desire for our core belief to be seen, understood and healed. But the same is not true for our scaffolding. Our rickety protective structure isn't pretty. In fact, sometimes, it’s downright cruel and hurtful. It’s hard to love. Surely, no one would take it on. No one would choose to take on the whole messed up reality of us. So, we hide it in plain sight. Behind walls designed to stop people seeing too much. Walls that stop people seeing our moving parts.
</p>
<p>Maybe we camouflage it, hoping no one notices it’s there. We exist in the shadows. Never letting anyone come close enough to spot it catching the light. Maybe we even keep it hidden inside our own relationships. Pretending not to have needs. Or carefully hiding our failings. It means we’re never fully present. Always calculating. How much can I show them? How close can I get without risking it all?
</p>
<p>Or maybe you make it bold and colourful. The envy of the street. So that everyone thinks it's the main event. Everyone loves you. But no one knows you.
</p>
<p>Maybe you’ve installed an assortment of booby traps. Ensuring anyone coming too close too quickly realises their lesson and retreats to the safety of their own structures. Too scared to attempt to approach again.
</p>
<p>Maybe, instead, you opt for the distraction. The smoke machine. Random noise and chaos. Aiming to create disorientation. Maybe deflecting attention by gossiping about the scaffolding of others. Hoping that becomes the bigger concern. You know you’re hurting your relationships, but at least you have a relationship to sabotage. If they knew the truth, you fear they wouldn’t even look back.
</p>
<p>Or maybe you just accept your structures. You tell people you are happy living behind them. Hiding in paralysis. You learn to make that self deprecating joke first. Learn to say, “It doesn’t matter anyway.” Learn to never chase that dream job. Or to ask out the person who obviously likes you. You think to yourself at least you are safe. Maybe you're not happy. But at least you are safe.
</p>
<h3>The Painful Catch 22</h3>
<p>The saddest truth is that these structures always fail us. Even when they work perfectly. And we get that validation. It’s never real. It never soothes the wound that still wants to heal.
</p>
<p>But to put them to one side. And risk being vulnerable. It may be virtuous. But it’s bound to get us hurt. And it’s probably the most dangerous option of them all. Because what’s certain in life? Death, taxes and being hurt by others. Especially the ones who love us the most.
</p>
<p>Because they’re all navigating their own mountains too. Hitting their own energy limits. So asking them to pause. To hear our honesty. Our openness. Just for a second. It could be asking for too much from them. We could be asking for more than they have to give. And then, even after all that risk. All that vulnerability. We could easily end up being even more hurt, even more alone.
</p>
<p>But ultimately, we also can’t heal ourselves. Because our core beliefs were supported by evidence. They were learnt. They were what kept us safe. Kept us alive. We can’t risk writing over them until we know the alternatives are safe. Until we’ve seen different outcomes. Gathered enough counter evidence. And unfortunately. We can only get this new evidence from the real, messy and imperfect people in our lives.
</p>
<p>And these are our painful catch 22s. The very people we need to heal us are the ones who are destined to hurt us. And the very structures we need to keep us safe are the ones stopping us from finding the real safety of being accepted for being ourselves.
</p>
<p>And if that wasn’t bad enough. There’s also another truth. Maybe the harshest truth of them all.
</p>
<p>The more we try to prevent people from hurting us. The less room we allow them to prove our insecurities wrong. And the insecurities we’re most desperate to hide are often wearing the mask of their opposite.
</p>
<p>Ultimatums are always coercive. Achievements are always props. Perfection is always performance. Any validation they bring is always counterfeit.
</p>
<h2>The Projection</h2>
<p>As we try to process our landscape we inevitably need to process the impact of others. If we can understand their intent we can protect ourselves better. We can help them better. We can judge them better. But projection is often the fundamental error we make. We assume their landscape has the same colour as ours. That an experience feels similarly to them as it does to us. We assume they would feel the same as us. Take the same as us. If they loved us they would do what we need them to do. Because they know how painful the energy limit is. If they loved us they would try to help us as we would help them. And so the only possible conclusion is that they don’t care enough. Or they don’t respect us enough.
</p>
<p>But this is the disconnect. We are only projecting. Their actions likely make sense in their own landscape, even if they don’t in ours. They are probably doing what they need to do to get down their own mountains. Their behaviour is a reasonable response to the actual landscape they are navigating.
</p>
<p>Take this example.
</p>
<p>Your lens is competency. So you try really hard to be a competent person. When your partner gets fired you see it as a catastrophic failure. From your perspective the only way down this mountain is to immediately start applying for jobs. This is your bypass. It stops you feeling the mountain. The rules of your structure don’t allow you to wait.
</p>
<p>You expect your partner to do the same. But their lens is relationship harmony. And they just need a hug. And to feel like you are there for them.
</p>
<p>When they get home you offer them a list of jobs. They look hurt. You don’t understand. Because through your lens this is the only logical way to feel better. So you conclude, they aren’t serious about being competent. This annoys you. Meanwhile, they are watching your actions through their own lens. And concluding you don’t care enough about them. Both of you are now more stressed, and more certain the other person isn’t right for you.
</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of Projection</h3>
<p>This is the tragedy of projection. No matter how much we want to be there for someone else. We often don’t know how to show up for them. And vice versa. Our attempts to connect often end up triggering each other. Sometimes in a perfect cycle. In our structure’s desperate need to be seen and heard, and understood implicitly we end up pushing away the very people, the very connections we need the most.
</p>
<h2>The Blocked Valley Paths</h2>
<p>But sometimes we don’t risk even trying to connect transparently. It feels way too dangerous. And this is a tragedy in itself. Because our steepest down paths—to our deepest valleys—often run straight into our biggest mountains. Which is why we keep painfully bumping into them. And if we are too busy trying to hide our structures. Well, then we have no hope of travelling down to them.
</p>
<p>In romantic relationships especially. The steepest slope—towards happiness, love, and connection often runs straight through a minefield.
</p>
<h4>I’m inadequate</h4>
<p>You just met someone perfect. But that’s what’s scary. No way would someone perfect waste their time with you. They just don’t know you yet. They can’t see who you really are. They can’t see that you’re damaged. That you're inadequate. You’re a failure. It’s the dark truth you carry around with you.
</p>
<p>Of course they aren’t going to stick around for that.
</p>
<p>But they’re your steepest gradient. Everything is pulling you towards them. You want to go to them. But you can’t help but feel the inevitable doom. The anxiety. And you feel envious. Anyone else could just roll down this hill. They’d be happy. Enjoying their new landscape. But you can feel the mountain creeping up on you.
</p>
<p>It was a nagging feeling at first, but now it's undeniable. You can see you’re barely coping. You begin to wonder why you aren’t feeling happy anymore. This is what you always wanted? Isn’t it? It has to be? But, actually, you’re starting to dread it now. You don’t think you want this. The only explanation is that maybe they aren’t right for you after all. I mean, if this was real love you’d know, wouldn’t you? There wouldn’t be any doubts. And the more you think about it. The taller the mountain rises. So much so, that there isn’t even a downward slope anymore.
</p>
<p>The next date they seem way too into you. They got you a gift. It feels too much. They’re moving too fast. They’ve obviously got issues. This is awkward. The pressure is rising in you. The longer you leave it, the more you'll hurt them. It’s better if you just break up with them now. No. It’s too hard right now. You’ll send them a text later. You didn’t like their hairstyle anyway. So it’s not a great loss.
</p>
<p>You've managed to find your path down, but it's not the one that leads to the valley. It’s just down the mountain of anxiety. And you’ve subtly reinforced your rule. Added a new piece of evidence to the idea that you can’t handle relationships.
</p>
<h4>“I will be abandoned"</h4>
<p>Let’s switch to the other side of the coin. The anxiously attached.
</p>
<p>Your partner hasn’t replied to your text for two hours. It feels like the end of the world. You're about to be abandoned. You can just sense it.
</p>
<p>You’re painfully aware of your mountain. You feel like you're too much. You know you keep pushing people away at times like this. It’s why people abandon you. It’s why this person is abandoning you.
</p>
<p>But the anxiety of waiting to find out what’s going on is unbearable. You literally cannot sit with it. You need to know right now. Am I being abandoned? Or not? You call them. They don’t answer. You knew it. You call them again. No answer. You’re in absolute panic. You need this to be over. Then at least you can start packing your bags. And face the reality of starting all over again. It's best to just know. So you know where you stand.
</p>
<p>The phone rings.
</p>
<p>It’s your partner. They're very sorry. They left their phone in a taxi. They finally got it back. They want to know if you're ok. They know you get anxious sometimes.
</p>
<p>Phew. It was just a random fluctuation in the landscape after all. But it was still too close for comfort. You nearly ruined everything. The evidence is clear. You were too much. You were over reacting. So you added a new peak to your foothills. Reinforcing that belief that you deserve to be abandoned.
</p>
<h2>Our Fascination</h2>
<p>Climbing our mountains is overwhelming and painful. Naturally, we avoid them if at all possible. We spend much of our lives building structures to avoid them. But that’s not the whole story. Because that attitude is not going to get us very far. In fact, it won’t get us to our valleys—the places we desperately want to get to. The places where we feel calm, and at peace with our full selves.
</p>
<p>We need to map our landscapes. Or we are going to keep hitting our mountains. But that is the problem. The closer we travel to the mountains, the sparser the paths, the thinner the air. And sometimes, our lens is simply not the best tool for the job. The mountain does not align with our lens, so our ability to map it is strained. We struggle to make the landscape make sense. And in trying to process it, we hit our energy limit.
</p>
<p>But we keep trying. Why? Because deep down, we know the truth. We know we are not unlovable. We know we are not inadequate. We know we are not unstable. We know we are not out of control.
</p>
<p>Trying to avoid the mountains only leads to the moments where we painfully learn we can’t. And that is why we are also drawn to them. Sometimes from a safe distance, and sometimes painfully close. This is why our lens is also our fascination. We sense, on some deep level, that understanding the most painful parts of our landscape is the key to traversing it better.
</p>
<p>But to recklessly charge up the steepest cliff is insanity. The goal is to broaden the corridors of our protective structures. Or loosen our grip just enough to feel brave enough to lean over their walls, to try placing one foot onto the mountains while holding onto the safety rails. From this vantage point we can start to survey our whole map. Start to question it. Wonder if our fears are justified. If some of our slopes might be gentler than we presumed.
</p>
<p>Or to widen our diversions. Start to loosen our grip on the behaviours of others. Learn to interpret their actions in the spirit they were intended. Train the guards of the watch tower in the actions of others rather than letting them trust their own instincts.
</p>
<p>For example, I will use myself.
</p>
<p>My lens is relationship harmony. I experience overwhelm related to relationship anxiety, and I am most triggered by personal conflict—even when it's only potential or perceived. It's no surprise, then, that I am endlessly fascinated by humans and what impacts our relationships. This fascination is my strategy: it helps me more accurately represent the truth behind a perceived conflict and therefore lower the energy of the raised path in my landscape. It’s the passion that created this framework.
</p>
<p>Someone else might be fascinated by logic, spending their life immersed in the human libraries of reason. Their anxiety comes from the chaos when someone close to them behaves illogically. Another person might feel anxiety about intense sensory experiences. To feel safe, they become fascinated by the immediate, learning to ground themselves in the texture and beauty of the present moment.
</p>
<p>And this is what helps us grow and heal. This continual pull towards better understanding. Knowing that if we want to get to the valleys, this is the only way to do it.
</p>
<p>Whether we know it or not, our mountains and their foothills—whether based in reality or elevated by anxiety—are our fascination. And it is only when we feel safe—when we are standing on a path that is already mapped—that we can find the freedom to risk the energy to look at them. To wonder if our fears are accurate. If there are better pathways to take. To search for insights that teach us slightly more about the terrain.
