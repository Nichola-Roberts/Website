You know the feeling. You just got home from work. It’s been a long, hard day. You collapse on the sofa. You don’t have the energy for anything. You know you have to cook dinner, to do your washing. But you can’t. You can’t even begin to think about doing them. Because you’re completely out of energy. 

You’re sitting there, trying to block out your thoughts, trying to focus on the tv. But your partner comes over and asks you how your day was. You snap at them. You don’t mean to. But replying is impossible. Your brain just wants to shut down. You don’t have the energy.

When you start looking at life from this perspective. That you have a mental energy limit that you can’t push beyond. Things start making a lot more sense. 

# Energy Landscape
Imagine you’re a ball, standing on a path in front of a vast landscape. There are hills, mountains and valleys. There are paths running everywhere. You see them tracing down the valleys. Winding round the mountains. Branching out. Joining back together. 

These paths represent all the actions you could take. From changing the show on netflix to hanging up the washing. Some paths stretch out far into the distance. For instance, you can just about make out that old pathway. The one you used to dream of. Quitting your job and retraining to follow your passion. But it seems so far away these days.

The valleys are the experiences that feel good. The simplicity of a hot bath. A holiday with your family. Or meeting someone and falling in love. 

The mountains feel huge. They’re stressful to even think about. Filling out important application forms. Not being able to afford your rent. Or the dread of having to face your controlling boss tomorrow. That one's a well-worn path you're forced to take, again and again. You know he's going to be unhappy with you. He always is. 

Mountains can also represent things that should be easy. Things you’re meant to enjoy. Like a loving conversation with your partner. Some days even that feels uphill.  

You can feel the pull of gravity drawing you down the valleys. And the effort of climbing the mountains. You know which paths you want to take. Which ones slope down. You don’t have to map them out. 

# Fluctuations
Our landscapes fluctuate constantly. The ground is always shifting around us and below us. Sometimes small shifts, sometimes monumental. 

Little events can have dramatic consequences. For instance, an unexpected bill arrives in the post. And suddenly, you're halfway up a mountain that wasn’t there before.

Or one dodgy look from a colleague. And instantly your anxiety rises. Your work task now feels impossible. Two seconds ago you were fine. Now you can’t focus. You can’t think straight. You no longer have the spare energy. A mountain has formed beneath your feet.

Luckily a work friend walks past. She notices you’re stressed. And she’s kind enough to listen intently as you talk it through. Now you’re feeling calmer. So you can think more clearly. You realise it was probably just your paranoia anyway. The mountain subsides. And you can concentrate on work again. Phew. 

Now imagine you’re a teenager instead. Full of life and feeling excited. You're about to go play football with your friends. However. Just as you’re walking out the door. Your mum shouts your name. She thinks you wound up your brother on purpose. And suddenly you start feeling stressed. It’s awful. But now you can’t go out. You can’t muster up any energy anymore. You just want to go to your bedroom. To be alone. A mountain has formed. 

Maybe you could flatten this mountain. Maybe you could defend yourself. Maybe your mum might be reasonable. Then you can calm down. And go out. Or maybe. Maybe arguing back might trigger one of her mountains. Lead to an escalation. Even more stress. And probably extra punishment. It’s not worth the risk. It’s better to hide your bedroom. 

Our landscapes are always changing and fluctuating. Often because of other people. Based on circumstances we don't know. And things we don't understand and can't control. It's chaotic, and often seemingly random like the butterfly effect. 

# Energy Limit
These fluctuations. Sometimes they throw us right up our mountains unexpectedly. 

These are the moments when life has pushed us too far. When everything feels impossibly hard. When we can feel our heartbeat thud. The anxiety rising in our chest. When it feels too much to bear. Like we are about to blow. This is our energy limit. When we hit it we lose our ability to think. And to do pretty much anything.  Except feel stressed. All our mental energy is taken up just trying to survive the moment.

Take this example. Your child goes missing at the park. A random fluctuation. But it's devastating to your system. You feel absolute panic. Instantly taken to your energy limit. Suddenly the only thing that matters is finding them. You've shifted to survival mode. All you care about is this one task. Finding your child. You’re hypervigilant. Even your partner's affair slips your mind. You scan the park. Focusing on any clues you can spot... Oh, wait. There they are. Everything is fine again. That’s a relief. Slowly the mountain starts to subside.

Or maybe you just had a job interview. And you didn’t get the job. You really wanted it, it felt perfect for you. You can't think straight. Now your thoughts are spiraling out of control in your mind. Your anxiety is peaking. You're trapped up at your energy limit unable to escape your thoughts. 

You really need to get your act together. Everyone is going to think you’re a failure if you keep getting rejected from these jobs. Your mind goes over all the stupid things you said. Like laughing at their jokes too hard. It came across as desperate didn’t it. And that awful answer. Why did you not think. You did a whole project on that last year. How could you not remember. You really will never find a job if you keep being this stupid in interviews. You’re sitting there ruminating. You’re meant to take your partner shopping. But how can you now. You can’t bear to leave the house. You don’t want to have to face the real world.

This is when you might snap at your partner. They ask how you are. And in theory you could have been nice to them. Apparently being nice costs nothing. But in this moment it feels beyond your abilities. You have no energy left to formulate a nice reply. 

At least snapping means the conversation is over. And they leave you alone for the rest of the night. It’s not that you don’t care about them. You do love them. Your brain’s just doing its best. It only has limited energy.

Sometimes we quickly return to our baseline. Like when we spotted our child and we relaxed. We gave them a hug. And then sat back down on the bench. We could feel our heart rate return to normal. And thoughts of the affair creep back into our mind.

Sometimes, however, it can last weeks. Like when we were worried about being a failure for not having a job. We can get stuck in our thoughts. And while we can distract ourselves or block it out. The mountain is there still. Just below our awareness. Vulnerable to any little knocks. Triggering us. Making it too big to carry on ignoring.

Understanding this helps explain why we're not lazy or mean. We're just working within our limited energy budget. This energy limit is relatively fixed. A height in our landscape we cannot go above.

Over time we learn to anticipate this height. And we become protective over it. We learn to avoid the dangerous paths. The events. The conversations. The risks. The things that could suddenly fluctuate and blow everything up.

# Planning 
Sometimes we can look out at our landscape and contemplate our paths. Maybe we can map them all out clearly. And choose with a clear head. We can calmly decide some risks aren't worth taking, no matter how big the reward might be. Or sometimes we might decide they are. 

But some paths. They feel scary. We don't want to even look at them. To acknowledge they exist. Like the test next week. Or making that hospital appointment we know we need. 

And this gets even harder when we are stressed. We can't plan our way out. It’s like a mountain fog blocks the paths we could take. So we can’t see them any more.

Take this example. 

Your dad died 6 months ago. It still feels awful. On top of that you hate your job. Two huge mountains. Intersecting below your feet. Holding you up at your energy limit.

Every day feels endless. There really is no end in sight. How can you even begin to feel better? You can’t. You’re just surviving. Trying to get through the next 5 minutes. High up on these mountains, right at your limit.

You’ve managed to carve yourself a little pocket. In bed, at 10am. Where you can just about breathe. Barely. But it still feels like relief. You can hide there for the moment. But all around you. In every direction, the landscape rises up. The paths go beyond your energy limit. Every task feels beyond your capabilities. 

Making a coffee is too much. Replying to a message, it’s too much. Getting out of bed, too much. You’re completely overwhelmed all the time. It’s uncomfortable to think about these tasks. To even glance at their paths. You just want to stay in your pocket.

And if you can’t even make coffee, how can you plan your way down the mountain? You feel absolutely trapped. You can’t face thinking about anything. You literally cannot even see the paths out. Even if others point them out. They stay purely theoretical. Not things you could actually do.

Now, instead. Imagine you have to make a presentation for your course. The path is obvious. Just start working. But every time you try to think about it, it feels too much. You immediately get stressed. Actually opening the laptop and starting on it. Well that’s impossible. 

You know the consequences. You just can’t make yourself do it. You know it’s procrastination. But what can you do? You always leave it to the last minute. But somehow it just seems to work. 

The days creep by. And lo and behold. Suddenly the day before it’s due you feel the focus coming. Just like you knew it would. A new mountain is rising quickly beneath your feet. You start to feel the inevitable stress of not finishing in time. And suddenly the consequences feel very real. You will fail your course if you don’t start right now. Right at this very moment. So quick, get the laptop. Get on that path.

The mountain you felt about starting is now eclipsed by a bigger, much more imposing mountain. This one represents failing your course. It’s taking you up high, right up to your energy limit. But it doesn’t feel like panic. It feels like focus. It’s shutting down your other thoughts. You’re entering fight or flight. All just to create a presentation. 

When we most need to plan our way out. When we're stuck in pain or desperation. Or facing a deadline. That's when the fog is thickest. The paths that seem so obvious to others aren't just hidden. It's like they don't exist.

# Relationships
But life isn't only full of climbing mountains. There are also the valleys. The moments that make it all worthwhile. Like falling in love.

Everyone knows the new relationship feeling. You feel happy, blissful even. The world feels new, and full of fresh opportunities. Maybe last week it was hard to get out of bed. But now everything has a purpose. Your whole landscape has shifted. You’ve rolled into a new valley you’ve never been to before. And suddenly everything looks different, much brighter. You feel like a whole new person. 

And it continues. Day after day. You feel the rush of energy as you roll down the slope. Gaining momentum. You can’t stop. Even if you wanted to. And there’s no way you want to. 

Your old problems don’t seem important. Your work day is as dull as ever. But it’s ok. Your mind is just fantasising about tonight. You can already picture telling your partner about that colleague's dodgy look. They’ll love the story. I mean what an idiot. Who does he think he is. He really needs to get a life and stop being obsessed with you.

Having someone reliably there for you changes everything. Someone you trust to listen to you and validate you as you share your life. It gives you a sense of home and safety. 

Over time you stay in this lower energy state. But it starts to feel normal. Your new baseline. This new landscape has mountains too. But they’re different mountains. You have more free energy. You can take bigger risks, make big life changes. Maybe decide to stand up for yourself. Like stop talking to your emotionally abusive father. Once and for all.

But unfortunately life also has heartbreaks. Your partner could call things off. And suddenly you’re half way up a mountain again. Without an easy path to get down. 

To make matters worse. Your dad calls when you're feeling particularly sad. He knew you would never be able to hold on to someone so great. What a mess. He was rude to you. And you just took it. Like the old days. Why did you let him say that to you?  Why did you not stand up for yourself?

# Emotions

## Navigating 
Our emotions are the signals that tell us about the landscape. They're the clues to the gradient of the slope. Whether we’re heading up a mountain or down into a valley. Each emotion is a cocktail of brain chemicals with a crucial message. Take this path and avoid that one.

We feel happy when we are travelling down. And when we're going up, our body screams to us that we’re going the wrong way.

## Learning
Emotions don't just guide us. They update the landscape itself. Every outcome is fed back into the system. Which is constantly being re-mapped to become a more accurate model of reality. This is how we learn. The emotional data tells us which paths to reinforce, and which ones lead to catastrophic mistakes.

It could be as simple as getting a free cake with your coffee order. It’s amazing. You update your landscape. And just like that. There’s a new downward path leading right back to their doorway. 

Or the update could be something big and awful. Like you saw your ex with their new partner at the park. A huge mountain forms. Right over the top of that park. You’re never ever gonna go there again.

Sometimes we’re too stressed, or too busy to process the emotions in the moment. So we mark off a huge area with warning barriers. This is a temporary fix. But we can come back to it later. When it’s safer. Then we can start to sift through what happened, to process the emotions and properly map the terrain.

So that evening, after seeing your ex, your mind drifts. You can feel the emotions all over again. You really just hate them. They broke your heart. 

But wait a minute. Actually. Now you’re thinking about it. It doesn’t feel as bad as you thought. The breakup was 8 months ago. And you had that really nice first date last week. Maybe you could risk the park. Oh no. That still hurts. You definitely can’t. But still, it’s good to notice you’ve made a small amount of progress. Maybe one day you’ll be ok.

Sometimes emotions reinforce what we already know. And sometimes they reshape our landscape completely. 

You find an incredible Thai restaurant. That first curry feels so amazing. You spend all week thinking about it. Telling everyone who will listen. You’re so excited to go back. You’re actively updating your landscape, to include this restaurant. And it feels kind of exhilarating.

Then three months later. You order the same curry. It still tastes exactly the same. It’s still amazing. But it's become normal. The emotions have been processed. The paths mapped. So there’s no need for the intensity anymore.

# Emotional Overload
Updating the landscape requires processing our emotions. But this means feeling it all. All over again. And that takes energy. A lot of energy if the experience was stressful. And when you're at your limit, that’s energy you just don't have.

## Everyday Overload
Imagine, you're having a fight with your partner. They keep going on. Point after point. Each one a new thing you've done wrong. A defense you have to form. But you can't think anymore. Your brain is overloaded. You just need it all to stop.

You snap you need space. They don't listen. They keep going on. You shut down. You can't even hear them anymore. They are just noise now. Deafening noise. Inside you are still begging for them to stop. You just can't bear it.

The next day they say sorry. They want to talk it over. But you can't. You’ve blocked it out. Blocked it off with warning barriers. You want to move on and forget about the whole thing. Pretend it never happened. 

Those barriers might stay up forever. Marking unmapped terrain. Or maybe a discussion, or even a weirdly helpful argument the next week, help you process it. Or maybe over time, it just fades away. But some experiences are too profound. Too monumental. They become defining features in our landscape.

## Trauma
You’re a child. You just fell over, and you’ve really hurt your leg. You start crying. And your mum shouts at you for exaggerating. But you’re not. You can barely walk. Your mum's stressed. She has an important meeting at work and she’s running late taking you to school. It’s her fault though. She lost the house keys. But anyway. She does try. She’s just very stressed. 

You try to walk. But oh my god does it hurt. You keep going. But you're limping along very slowly. You can tell your mum is annoyed. She stares you straight in the eyes, and tells you "We don't have time for this. Get yourself together. Why can't you just be normal for once. Sometimes I wish I'd never had children" Now that one really, really does hurt. Ouch. 

You fall to the floor in a ball. You can barely breathe. You feel so upset. So so upset. But now your mum is even more annoyed. She needs to get to work. So she drags you up by your arm. 

So there you are, getting dragged along. You’re still upset. But you have no choice. Sitting on the floor feeling sorry for yourself made it worse. So you have to keep going. But now you’re more detached. Thinking what you can do to make this ok? Crying doesn’t help. Feeling sorry for yourself doesn’t help. You just need to shut off these emotions somehow. Stop listening to them. They’re not doing you any good. She treats you worse when she can see your emotions. 

You finally get to school. You still can’t concentrate. People try to talk to you all day. But you can barely hear them. You just need to get through the day. But why. What’s better about being at home. Your life is one bad situation after another. A mountain range of trauma. 

There’s no one to make you feel safe. No one to tell you it wasn’t your fault. So you cry alone in bed that night. Blaming yourself, if only you could be a better child, then maybe your mum would love you better, take care of you better. Maybe you wouldn’t be a burden to her life and she wouldn’t regret your existence.

# Core Beliefs
And this is how core beliefs are formed. Often in childhood. Extreme moments that shape our landscape profoundly. These mountains will remain for much of our lives. 

That child had no other options. Their survival depended on their mum. And they learned their landscape. Telling their mum how they felt was a path that only made things worse.

Making themselves small kept them safe. It’s backwards, but, to be cared for the child had to act like their existence was a burden. Because then, sometimes, on her good days, that allowed their mum to have the energy to care for them.

This was the most accurate map they had. The only landscape that worked.

In adulthood we are so used to the presence of these mountains that we barely notice them. 

No. Actually. We do notice them. They’re there in our every action. In our every decision. We navigate our daily lives around them. We just don’t really think about them. 

Because they’re our mountains. Our biggest insecurities. Our deepest fears. They are stressful and painful to think about. So we just don’t. But they are still there. Lurking. They’re the “truths” that we map our daily lives around. 

## “I’m worthless”
“I’m worthless” Believes the adult who was told they were a waste of space. 

They don’t dare hope someone might do them a kind deed. Or forgive them for a mistake. They’re always careful. Making sure they never put upon others. Why ask for anything when you know you’re worth nothing. They don’t want to put others in an awkward situation. Don’t want to force them to have to say the truth out loud. They don’t want the hurt of having that pointed out explicitly. Yet again. 

## “I’m a failure”
Another child might have been taught “You’re a failure” at school. 

They noticed they were always the last to finish their work. Or the teacher came to check on them more than the others. As they got older they struggled with tests and exams. Each struggle seemed to confirm what they feared. That everything is more difficult for them. No matter how hard they try. When they grew up, they also failed job interviews. They finally got a job at a supermarket. But then it closed down.

Now they go to the job centre. And oh my god is it stressful. It’s so hard for them to think about getting another job. They go to so many interviews. And in every one, they have to face the interviewer. Look them in the eye. And all they can think is, they see it too. They see the failure. They are wondering why this person even bothered showing up. Why would anyone hire them?

## "I'm Too Much"
Another child was taught their feelings were too much. When they cried they were told to grow up. When they were excited, they were told to calm down. They learned that their emotions were a dangerous force that pushed people away. 

As an adult, their relationships are filled with anxiety. They’re terrified that if their partner sees their true feelings they will leave. So they try to hold them in. But they can’t. The feelings are too big. And when they finally burst out, they can feel themselves being "too much." And they hate themselves for it.

## “Other People Are More Important"
Sometimes a child will learn they need to prioritise others over themself.  

Their parent is always overwhelmed. So no one takes care of the child. No one cooks dinner. No one washes their clothes. Their parent is always stressed and shouting. 

So they learn to calm their parent. Remove their stresses. Do the washing themselves. Take care of the other children. Become their emotional sounding board. Only then does their parent become ok. Becomes fun to be around. Caring. Loving. Everything they want.  

So the child learns to watch the emotions of others. And it carries on into adulthood. They see it as their job to make sure everyone else is ok. When a friend is sad, they feel sad. And it feels worse than if it was their own sadness. When their partner is stressed, they need to fix it. They don’t feel any peace until everyone else is ok first.

## “I’m on My Own”
Someone else had a single parent who never had the time to help. They were working two jobs, and were always stressed. When they needed help tying their shoelaces, their mum was too busy. When they needed help with their maths homework, their mum was too busy. When they were being bullied and needed support, their mum was too busy. 

They learnt “I'm on My Own”. So as an adult at work they can’t ask for help. They get in trouble for failing to do tasks. But they still can’t bring themselves to ask for help. When they’re at home their partner asks them how they are. They say I’m fine. What else are they meant to do. They don’t want to burden their partner with the reality of who they are.

## "I Can't Trust Anyone"
This child was hurt time after time. Their dad was violent. Their mum a drug addict who barely came home. Their grandma punished them for every little thing. Their teacher thought they cried too much. And punishing them for not concentrating was the solution. 

They kept trying new tactics. Maybe if I'm nicer to my grandma, she will be kinder. Maybe if I explain calmly to the teacher why they I'm sad, she might understand. But nothing ever worked.

They kept hoping the next person would be different. But their new friend just told everyone their secrets. And then stopped talking to them.

Every false hope caused the final betrayal to hurt even more.

So they learnt vulnerability was a weakness. It would always get them hurt. 

As an adult they never trust anyone. They never truly let anyone in. Even when they want to. Because that’s the trick. That’s when they get hurt the most. In a world where you can’t trust anyone. You have to be smart. You have to play the system. Learn to get what you need. Without risking a thing.

## “Don’t Trust Reality”
Another child has their reality dismissed. 

Maybe their mum forgot their birthday. They casually mentioned it to her on the day. And their mum even said sorry.

But then a week later. She denied she forget. That she'd got them a present. It was confusing. The child knows it didn’t happen. Or at least they think they know. They can’t find any evidence of a present anyway. But maybe they lost it. They don’t think they got one. But then, their mum seems so sure.

Their mum makes them perform the lie. Makes them say thank you.  It’s getting more confusing. What’s the truth? But the child does still know deep down. They just aren’t allowed to think it anymore. It gets buried deep inside. And a false narrative lives over the surface.

These are just some of the mountains that could have formed. Each person's landscape is unique. Someone could have one core belief. Someone else could have several, all interlinking.

# Triggers
When your landscape's full of mountains, your baseline stress is high. You’re living at a high altitude. Always vigilant. Every potential fluctuation feels dangerous. Any one of them a trigger that could send you right up a peak. Especially around your core beliefs.

And the saddest thing is, the steepest paths downwards often run straight through our biggest mountains. Which is why we keep bumping into them. In romantic relationships especially. The path towards happiness, love, and connection runs right through a minefield.

## “They’ll see who I really Am”
You just met someone perfect. But that’s what’s scary. No way would someone perfect waste their time with you. They just don’t know you yet. They can’t see who you really are. They can’t see that you’re damaged. That you're emotionally inadequate. The dark truth you carry around with you. 

Of course they aren’t going to stick around for that.

But they’re your steepest gradient. Everything is pulling you towards them. You want to go to them. But you can’t help but feel the inevitable doom. Someone else could just roll down this hill. They’d be happy. Enjoying their new landscape. But you can feel the mountain creeping up on you. 

And now you think about it. You’re actually barely coping. Why are you not feeling happy anymore. This is what you always wanted? Isn’t it? Maybe they aren’t right for you after all. If this was real love you’d know wouldn’t you. There wouldn’t be any doubts. The more you think. The more the mountain rises. You can’t feel the downward slope anymore. 

The next date they seem way too into you. They got you a gift. It's too much. They’re moving too fast. They’ve obviously got issues. This is awkward. The pressure is rising in you. The longer you leave it, the more you'll hurt them. It’s better if you just break up with them now. No. It’s too hard right now. You’ll send them a text later. You didn’t like their hairstyle anyway. It’s not a great loss. You’ve found your path down. It’s just down the mountain. Not down the valley.

## “I’m about to be abandoned"
Your partner hasn’t replied to your text for two hours. It feels like the end of the world. You're about to be abandoned. You can just sense it. 

You’re painfully aware of your mountain. You feel like you're too much. You know you keep pushing people away at times like this. This is why people abandon you. This is why this person is abandoning you.

But the feeling of waiting to find out is unbearable. You literally cannot sit with it. You need to know right now. Have I been abandoned? You call them. They don’t answer. You knew it. You call them again. No answer. You’re in absolute panic. You need this to be over. Then at least you can start packing your bags, and face the reality of starting all over again. It's best to just know. 

The phone rings.

It’s your partner. They're very sorry. They left their phone in a taxi. They finally got it back. They want to know if you're ok. They know you get anxious sometimes. 

Phew. It was just a random fluctuation in the landscape after all. 

These repeated experiences reinforce our mountains. Turning them into mountain ranges of connecting peaks, all circling around the same dark “truth”.

# Emergency Escape Routes 
When you’re up a mountain. Stressed out of your mind. It feels unbearable. You can’t sit with it. You can’t wait until you calm down. It’s killing you. You need to get down. Right now. This very second. 

Your brain’s in crisis. You have no ability to plan ahead. To consider the longer term consequences. To think through the best path. You just need to take the fastest path down. Right now.

This is when we use our emergency escape routes. The moments in our lives we are probably the least proud of. The ones that fill us with a sense of shame when we look back at them. Everyone has their own set. Heavily dependent on what worked in childhood. 

## Control 
As a child you were neglected. Your parents never had time for you. You only got attention when you were causing trouble. 

And yes, your parents were angry. But at least in that moment they remembered you existed. You impacted the world. Your brother was told not to wind you up. To let you play on the console. Even though it wasn’t your turn. It was your little glimpse of what love feels like. What it means to feel important.

As you get older, you learn other people can be manoeuvred. And this helps you regulate when you're stressed. Let’s imagine you have a core belief “I will never be enough”.

Your partner is out at the pub with her friends. You can feel the panic start to build. All the potential scenarios playing out in your mind. She's happy. Having fun. Laughing at you. Probably talking about how you shouted yesterday. And now she's thinking of leaving you. 

You can picture it now.  Someone’s come over. They're hitting on her. And she’s weighing up her options. You can just tell what's going to happen. She won’t be coming home tonight. She’ll be staying with him. Oh actually. You’ve just remembered. The new guy at work. She thinks his jokes are funny. It drives you mad. He's probably there.

The thoughts are getting louder. Too much to bear. You don’t want to be this person. You want to be a good partner. So you try to calm yourself. To think rationally. But it’s not working. It's overwhelming. You can’t live in this state. So what can you do. You have to do something. She shouldn’t be making you feel this way.

If she cared she wouldn’t want you to be this distressed. And ultimately. You are just asking for what you deserve. You should call her and ask her to come home. 

You could ask her nicely. But what if she says no. Last time she said no. And it hurt. A lot. Even more than it’s hurting now. It proved how little she prioritises you. You can’t take that risk again. You need a guarantee.

You pick up the phone. “How dare you go out and flirt with him. Do you not care about me? You need to come home right now. Or I don’t know what I will do.”

She says ok. Your mountain has gone. She's coming home. None of these imaginary scenarios can happen. She will be at home with you. However, she now has a brand new mountain in her landscape. And she can’t go to the pub with her friends anymore. 

Over time your landscape has become manageable. Life is just a little bit easier. She knows you can’t cope with certain things. She’s learnt to care about you better. Not trigger you so much. But. Little do you know. She’s just learnt to walk on eggshells. To preempt things that might set you off. Her landscape is full of new mountains. “I can’t see my friends”, “I can’t stand up for myself”, “I can’t think about my own needs”. You feel calmer. But she feels trapped.

Control is just one kind of escape strategy. Some are loud and aimed at others. And some are quiet and pointed inwards.

## Distraction
You might have learnt to ignore your emotions. Block them out through compartmentalisation. Or distance yourself with logical dissection. Maybe you learnt to distract yourself with exercise, shopping, food, or self-harm. Or scroll endlessly on TikTok. Or you learnt to suppress the feelings directly, with drugs or alcohol.

## Desperation
Instead. You might have learnt to make your emotions so loud they are impossible for others to ignore. You might beg and plead when you fear abandonment. “Please, I can’t cope without you”. “I don’t know what I would do if you left”. You feel so desperate. If they could see how deeply you were hurting. Maybe then they would help you down your mountain. 

## Manipulation
You might have learnt the world doesn’t listen to your truth. 

Your partner wants to go away for the weekend with their family. And you can already feel your abandonment mountain rising. You don't want to spend the whole weekend on this mountain. But the sad thing is. You can't ask them not to go. You know exactly what would happen if you did. 

There would be an argument. And they'd probably still go anyway. So. So you tell them you have a sudden medical appointment. You tell them you need their support. That you're worried.. It's slightly true. It's 3 weeks away. You feel bad. But the guilt is manageable. At least you can sit with the guilt. You couldn't sit with the mountain.

## Devaluation 
Imagine your partner is having a go at you. Just because you didn’t want to go to their work event. I mean, fair enough right. No one wants to go to that stuff.

But now they're going on and on. Listing every little thing they've done for you recently. And honestly, it’s getting boring. They chose to do these things. You didn’t ask them to. And they shouldn’t have done them if they were going to hold them against you.

You're barely listening. But then all of a sudden. They've hit a target. Struck a nerve. Probably just luck, but suddenly the boredom's gone. And now you need to stop them. So you say something you know will hurt them. Something to take them down from their high horse. That you were only with them for their money anyway. You smile inside. You feel proud. You know this one will hurt.

And it does. You feel superior for a moment. And it brings a calm. But you see their face change. Now they're saying they want to break up with you. 

Panic hits. It’s just got serious. And it feels unbearable. How could they do this to you?

But you know how. It's because they're pathetic. Weak. So desperate to be liked they just build resentment instead of standing up for themselves. They're not worth much. You can do so much better. Really you should have left a long time ago.

Suddenly, you don’t feel hurt anymore. How could someone so small hurt you? It’s not you that’s flawed. It’s them. And their whole worthless being. 

## Self Sacrifice 
Let’s imagine you were the child who learnt “I am a burden”. Today you got bullied at school. So you’re relieved to be home. But you're still feeling really upset. It’s hard to get everything off your mind. 

Then your mum gets home from work. She's just worked two shifts. And had an argument with her ex. She looks at you. Then does a double take. She can see you were crying. Oh no. 

It sends her even further up her own mountains. This one, in particular, represents her insecurity about being a bad parent. She knows she's failing you. But that knowledge is too much for her to bear. 

She snaps. She needs you to be ok. She needs to end the guilt you're creating in her. “Grow up. It’s not the end of the world. I have enough going on already. You'll push me over the edge if you keep this up”

Right. Pull yourself together. Dry your eyes. You’re just making everything worse. You can see your mum visibly relax. Look. She’s right. You’re fine. You don’t need to ruin everything. Just put it out of your mind. Help her bring the shopping in. That will help her calm down. And then maybe she’ll have some time for you later. Because you've helped her with her stress. You’ve learnt your only way down your mountain is to block everything out. 

You've learnt. If you give endlessly, how could you be a burden? 

This is a strategy you carry into adulthood. Logically. If you never ask for anything then you can’t be a burden. And no one can trigger your core belief. But the problem is, now you’ve expanded its footprint. Now. If someone doesn’t need your help. You must be an even bigger burden than you thought. Even when all you’re trying to do is help. Somehow you’re still in the way.

## The New Mountain
Everyone has their own strategies. But one thing is always true. When people feel the unbearable, they will do absolutely anything to get down. 

And to make things even worse. These can become their own core beliefs. A new connecting mountain range. Your escape strategy becomes its own mountain. You learn “I am dangerous”, or “I’m an alcoholic”, or “I need to lie to be accepted”. 

So now you’re trapped between two mountains. The one you were running from. And the one you built to get away.

And the very worst part? People can see this new one. Your escape route. The one that's automatic. It becomes a label. "Controlling", "Alcoholic", "Manipulator". A new mountain of shame. One that others feel justified pointing out. Right to your face.

# Protective Structures
These emergency escape routes might have got us down the mountain. But it was messy and painful. Far from ideal.

So over time, we developed better systems. We built defenses. Walls and rules designed to protect our mountains. Trying to ensure triggers never get within touching distance of our vulnerabilities. These are our protective structures.

And when someone questions or challenges these structures, we feel justified defending ourselves. Because, we know, that deep down. Below this mountain. Behind all our defences, lies our most innocent and fragile self. So, of course, we are going to feel a responsibility to keep it safe.

## Monitoring 
Imagine, as a child, every decision was made for you. You were taught “I have no autonomy.” 

There were rules for chores. For homework. For when you could see your friends. Rules for your phone, your TV, your music. Rules for what you could wear, what you could say, even what you were allowed to think. It was like your life was something happening to you. Now, as an adult, every compromise hits that same loss of autonomy. Triggering that original wound. The same powerlessness. The feeling that your voice, your wishes, your safety simply doesn't matter enough. And it still hurts. A lot. 

The only way to feel even remotely ok. And in control. Is by designing defences that finally create a space for yourself. So you check your partner’s phone. Because you need to know where they are. Who they’re with. What time they’re coming home. Everything. Not because you don’t trust them. But because their actions impact you. And you will be damned if you let someone have that much control over your life. Again.

They were back an hour late last time they were out with their brother. You remember sitting at home. Waiting. Feeling like your autonomy was out of control. All over again. So this time. You explain yourself. Calmly. You emphasise how important it is for them to stick to their word. To be courteous. Honorable. And you make sure they are clear. This isn't a preference you have. It's a non-negotiable part of a relationship with you. 

You don’t want to control them. You just want control over your own life.

## Manipulation 
And maybe over time. You learn even that doesn’t work. You feel like you've been kind one too many times. And you can finally see it all clearly now. Everyone in life is playing their own game. Solely looking out for themselves. You’ve been taught the world is cruel. And if you don't play the game then you lose automatically.

Your partner wants to go out with their friends. And normally it would be ok. But not these friends. These friends think you’re problematic.

And it is so frustrating. Because you know what’s really going on. You see through it all. These friends are always planting seeds. Twisting your actions. Suggesting your partner is not being treated well. That they should stand up for themselves more. But it’s not accurate. Your partner only tells them their side. Not the full story.When your partner asks if you're ok with it. You think no. You're not. You can feel the panic rising. But what can you do? Then it pops into your mind. You’re reminded about a comment you overheard recently. These friends think your partner talks too much. Well that’s not quite what they said. You've twisted it slightly. You know you have. But it wouldn't work if you didn't.

It slips out before you really think about it. You see your partner’s face drop. They're embarrassed. And decide to stay home with you.

Maybe you did lie a little. But everyone does. At least you are protecting yourself. You're not naive. You've been stomped on too many times to play fair.

## Keeping Score
Maybe you have a mountain representing “I have no value”.

You're on constant guard. Always scanning. Looking for moments when your value is overlooked. People prove it to you all over again. Your friends. Your family. Your partner. Your coworkers. Every time someone doesn't give back equally you sense it immediately. The emptiness. The loneliness. Knowing yet again that you are not valued enough to be treated well. No one thinks you need reciprocation. You are always over looked. Just not important enough. And it's not right.

Last night you listened to your partner talk about work for hours. Tonight it should be your turn. You've had an awful day at work. You feeling like quitting and you want to talk about it. You told your partner. But they won't cancel their plans with their friends. They won't even pop home first. There's a quiet rage inside you. You don't know what to do do about it. But it won't go away. In fact the more you think about it. The bigger it becomes. You feel a raw indignation about the injustice of it all.

No matter what you do. You can't quiet your mind. And there's list that keeps growing the more think about it. Each item you add triggers a new wave of anger. 6) they've also not done the washing up. And 7) they've not paid their half of the electricity. 8) or the take away last week. The evidence is mounting up.

They take you for granted. Just like everyone else does. You’re the kind of person who gets taken for granted. And it's not fair. You can't take it anymore. You just want someone to care about you enough. Just once. For someone to notice your needs. And care about them.

You know you deserve better than this. You deserve to be valued.

You double down your commitment to your mental scorecard. Maybe you even start a real spreadsheet. Every interaction is weighed up and measured. You can't help it. It's automatic. You start making rules. Bills have to be split exactly. Chores assigned rigidly. Then at least your value can be proven. You will make sure you get your value back. What ever it takes. No one is going to be taking advantage of you anymore.

## Competence
Maybe you were taught your worth is tied to your competence.

Your parents didn’t know how to meet you where you were. As a whole, beautifully complex person.

They didn’t know how to be there when you fell out with your friends. When you failed your spelling test. When you fell over. Or even when you won the school award for best poem.

But they were always there for gymnastics. At gymnastics you had their attention, their love. Even your sadness about falling brought connection. At gymnastics you had worth.

Now as an adult. You feel alive when achieve. In fact it's the only time you ever really feel ok. In between successes a stark reality starts to creep in. Am I valuable without an achievement on display? And it's uncomfortable to think about.

But it's also what drives you. Powers you to achieve more than others. Which ensures you stay special. And therefore deserving of taking up space on this planet.

This pattern follows you into your job.

You’ve just finished a challenging project. Everyone's been working hard for months. You’re proud of what the team has achieved. Your contribution was the most important. Of course. But everyone did well.

Your manager asks a colleague to present the results at a stakeholder meeting. It should have been you. It really should have been you. It's infuriating.

Anyway. In the meeting the colleague answers a question. He explains one of your core ideas. But he doesn't mention your name. The rage intensifies.

You watch the faces in the room light up. They're impressed. It's maddening.

You did that. And he's getting the credit. You know it will look desperate. Petty, even. You don’t want to. But you have to say it. You can't help it. “I actually did that part.”

You feel embarrassed. But you had to. You had to get your worth on the record.

Over time, it becomes a habit. You document all your contributions. You steer conversations towards your achievements. It becomes an insatiable hunger. Because without the constant proof, you feel like you are worth nothing. Just like you always feared you were deep down.

And as if this wasn’t bad enough. Later that year someone new joins the team. They keep getting better results than you.

At first you thought it was luck. But it keeps happening. And you've worked out how. They are cheating the system. They are picking the easiest projects. No one else can see it though. People keep complimenting them. Like they are great. You feel that old drive to achieve kicking in. Full force.

But it's not working like it used to. You don't line up and get scored fairly like in gymnastics. Workplace politics mean you aren't being seen. The metrics are being manipulated. It's just not right.

Later that day. You watch them making jokes. Everyone's laughing. The idiots. Why can't they see through them. See they are being played.

Your anger is hugely motivating still. But you're running out of options to channel it down. How can you prove your worth now. No one is paying you any attention.

The emptiness is becoming louder. Unbearably so. The motivation getting stronger and stronger. You think to yourself. You need to show everyone the truth. Show everyone they are a charlatan. That they are the one who is worthless. Not you. You have no alternative.

## Self Sacrifice 
Maybe you protect yourself by always giving.

As a child you were constantly punished. Whether you did something wrong or not. Maybe you were taught there was something inherently bad within you. So you learnt to be a good person. To always do the right thing. To hold yourself to the highest standards. A perfectionist over your own character.

Now you’re the one in the friendship group who's s always there. You lend money. Buy gifts. Listen to everyone’s problems. Even organise the events. You’re indispensable. You know it. They know it. But you have to be. Because you don’t believe you are worth much.

Why would anyone keep you around unless you compensate. Overcompensate. This way your friends know your worth. Because you are constantly demonstrating it. Proving it. They’d be mad to let you go.

But when you haven't given for a while. The feeling builds inside. What if they have stopped needing me. What if I am not valuable any more. My personality isnt enough to maintain these relationships. Quick let's bake them a cake.
And it's even worse when someone thinks a bad thought about you. Or makes a bad comment. It kills you inside.

But no you can't be bad. You know it can't be true. You are a good person. You try so hard to be good. You know that you are. You have to be.

Because if the criticism were true. If, after all that effort, you were still bad. What could you do? What would that say about you?

## Hiding Yourself
Maybe your core belief is “I am different”. 

You feel like people can spot it a mile off. It’s in everything you do. You believe no one would take you seriously if they knew the real you. So you try to hide. To exist in the shadows. You watch everyone else, trying to learn the rules. Trying to work out the correct way. But you always mess it up. Your protective mask always slips. And you can feel them sensing it.

You feel jealous. Other people just get to be. They live without thinking, and the world accepts them. But you have to put on a front for normal interactions. Small talk feels impossible. What is the correct way to answer “How are you?” or “What are you doing this weekend?”. Why did you not get a copy of this rule book?

Maybe instead it’s “I’m not a real adult”. A feeling that everyone else has a competency you failed to develop. Maybe it’s “I’m broken” or “I’m too much”.  A belief that if someone saw the real you they wouldn’t stick around. 

Maybe it's a deep secret you hold. Something from childhood that got locked away. That still feels too dangerous to speak about, even now. You can still hear their voice sometimes "Don't ever tell anyone about this." Or maybe it's something you were taught is shameful. Like being gay. Whatever the reason, the reality is the same. You have to hide the real you. At all costs.

So you are never fully present. You are always calculating how much can you show them. How close can you be without risking it all being taken away.

## Beat Them To It
Maybe you believe everyone has the truth about you ready to go. Right on the tip of their tongue. About to hit you at any moment. So you learn to make that self deprecating joke first. Learn to say “It doesn’t matter anyway”. Learn to never chase that dream job. Or to ask out the person who obviously likes you. 

But sometimes that's not enough. Sometimes you have to push them away first. Before they get the chance to do it to you.

You can't stop the pain of reality. But you can soften the impact.

## The Painful Catch 22
The saddest truth is that these structures always fail us. Even when they work perfectly. And we get that validation. It’s never real. It never soothes the wound we were trying to heal. 

But to put them to one side. And risk being vulnerable. It may be virtuous. But it’s bound to get us hurt. It’s probably the most dangerous option of them all. Because what is certain in life? Death, taxes and being hurt by others. Especially the ones who love us the most. 

Because they’re all navigating their own mountains too. Hitting their own energy limits. So asking them to pause. To hear our honesty. Our openness. Just for a second. It could be asking for too much from them. We could be asking for more than they have to give. So even after all that risk. All that vulnerability. We could easily end up being even more hurt, even more alone. 

But ultimately, we also can’t heal ourselves. Our core beliefs were supported by evidence. They were learnt. They were what kept us safe. Kept us alive. We can’t risk writing over them until we know it’s safe. Until we’ve seen different outcomes. Gotten counter evidence. And unfortunately. We can only get this new evidence from the real, messy and imperfect people in our lives. 

And these are our painful catch 22s. The very people we need to heal us are the ones destined to hurt us. And the structures we need to keep us safe, also stop us from healing. 

And if that wasn’t bad enough. There’s also another truth. Maybe the harshest truth of them all. 

The more we try to stop people from hurting us. The less chance we have to heal. 

Ultimatums are always coercive. Achievements are always props. Mirages are always masks. Using these tools can never prove to us our worth. 

# Erosion
And while that sounds very fatalistic. Absolute doom and gloom. It's not. Our mountains might feel permanent. Insurmountable even. But they can and they do erode.

## Time
Think about your worst break up. How you didn’t think you’d ever recover. Life didn’t feel like living anymore. You were sure you would never love like that again. 

But now. Looking back. 10 years later. The memory is distant. In fact, it’s a bit absurd. It might as well have been someone else’s life. You can see it very clearly now. They were never right for you. 

But at the time it was devastating. You cringe thinking about it. How you tried to be friends. Even though it broke you. Pretending to be happy for them when they got a new partner. It’s embarrassing to think about. 

Back then. Your whole landscape was shaped around them. Every path rolled down towards them. The gravity of your old life kept pulling you back. Only to feel the thud. The thud of them caring less. The thud of them moving on. Every path you took to reach them, led to them walking further away. 

You remember the song you played on repeat. The one that spoke directly to your broken heart. It’s funny to think about now. You also remember your friends' endless patience. The times you cried together over a rom-com. The way their wisdom helped you see the flaws in the relationship more clearly. 

And then you remember the day you bumped into them in the street. A few years later. You were genuinely pleased to see them. You said hello. Asked how they were. And then just carried on with your life. 

## Processing
Healing from our core wounds is harder. It's often a whole interconnected mountain range. One we’ve spent a lifetime building detours around. And these bypasses are deep and well worn. So we rarely feel brave enough to take the sharp turn and look at it head on. 

But sometimes we can. Sometimes we take that dusty single lane road. And start the hard, and scary process of processing the pain of our past.

A therapist can give you some of the validation you never got as a child. They might say things like "Yes, what happened to you was bad." or "You did well to survive that." And for the first time. It feels safe to think maybe it wasn't your fault. Maybe these things weren’t failings of you. Maybe what happened was enough to harm anyone. Maybe you're not actually broken. And maybe. Just maybe. You can heal.

So, slowly you test them. Do they really accept you? Or are they being nice because they're paid? Can you actually trust them with your deepest fears?

You imagine telling them. But then you also imagine seeing the truth in their face. Their flinch. Their awkwardness. And then you imagine their lie. Having to pretend you’re normal. That your behaviour wasn’t that bad. Because that's their job. They have to tell you they accept you.

But if a therapist can’t accept you. Then you know that no one can. You can’t take any risk on this.

Over time you slowly circle closer and closer. They seem to like you. Enjoy your company. Maybe you should trust them with the truth. But actually. What is the truth? You don’t even know the truth. All you have is a tangled web of memories, and feelings you were told were wrong. You can’t actually tell them any truth. You can’t find it yourself.

Together you work through things. You process some painful memories. Gain some new understanding. Then suddenly it hits you both. You believe love is something you have to earn. But you can never be good enough to earn it. That’s it. That’s the rule you’ve been living your whole life around.

You knew it on some level. That mountain was always there. But now you’ve mapped it. You feel relieved. You can see you've been treating relationships like a job interview. Trying to prove to them, and to yourself that you’re valuable. 

You're not cured. The mountain of unworthiness is still there. But for the first time, you can see it. You can look at it. And it’s ludicrous. Everyone deserves love. You know you can’t make someone love you by doing tasks.

In reality. You’ve been controlling them. While hiding yourself. You’ve never given anyone the autonomy to love you for you. To start to erode your mountains.

## Counter Evidence
Nothing has the power to both hurt and heal us like romantic relationships. 

Imagine you’re dating someone new. And you have a core belief that you’re too much. 

It’s date seven now. They seem to like you. It’s nice. You’re still in the honeymoon period. Free falling down the slopes. Ecstatically happy. All your paths are aligning towards them. Towards their gravity. And it’s starting to feel like fate. Meant to be. Like meeting them was inevitable. 

And it feels blissful. You’re not affected by any of your normal triggers. Your brain is happily taking risks and creating new neural pathways. 

Take last week for example. You casually mentioned that it hurt when they didn't kiss you goodbye. You braced yourself for a fight. But then. Then, they just said they were sorry. They were in a rush. They felt bad. Then. The next time they left, they went out of their way to make you feel special.

That’s not how it's supposed to work. People are supposed to get defensive. To call you needy. To hurt you back. But it seems like. Well. Maybe. Maybe, this person doesn't actually. Um. Think you are too much. 

And with every kind word. Every promise kept. They’re slowly rewriting your landscape.

Then, the next week. Your mum calls. She makes a seemingly harmless comment. “Oh, your sister did that last week. She said it was easy. But you’ve always found these things a little bit harder, haven't you? So you did really well.” 

You know it's just how she is. She doesn't mean it how you took it. But it still knocks you. Why is she always like this?

A lot of people have worse childhoods. You shouldn’t let it affect you so much. You must be weak. Sticks and stones and all that. Your mum just has a knack of making you feel worthless. Like. Like you were the consolation prize child. And it really gets to you. Even though you know it shouldn’t.

Later your partner comes round. They can see you’re upset. It feels embarrassing. You don’t want to tell them. You’re overreacting. It’s only a little thing. And you know how people normally react.

Normally they’re dismissive. They say like "All parents damage their kids." or “Oh my mum was like that too”. Which is just the polite way of saying your pain doesn't count. This isn’t big enough to matter. You should have got over it a long time ago.

Your partner really wants to know though. They’re pushing you. So you take the risk. And they listen. Weird. But suddenly you realise three hours have passed. And they’re still there. Still listening. You feel something you’ve never felt before. Validation. Security. Like maybe your mum’s words were cruel. And maybe it’s ok.

Maybe, just maybe your emotions are valid. Maybe you aren't too much. Maybe people don’t leave when they know you better. Maybe sometimes you are emotional. Sometimes you do cry. But maybe that’s ok. Maybe people will love you anyway.

## Resolving Friction
But inevitably one day. When you are both stressed. And you both have other things on your mind. You have an argument. And it’s a big one. Your partner was supposed to meet your parents, but they cancelled at the last minute. Said they had to work. It feels suspicious. You're not sure you believe them.

That evening you try to talk to them. But they aren’t listening. You’re feeling unheard and dismissed. You don’t know what to do. They don’t seem to be able to hear you. In your frustration you tell them they’re a rubbish partner. They storm off and won’t answer your calls. It all feels so sudden. So out of character.

But it turns out your mountains directly oppose each other. Your “I’m too much” has collided with their “I’m not enough”. By trying to get down your mountain, you pushed them up theirs.

Solving these patterns is where the hard work begins. Years of trial and error. Cycles of hurt and healing. Hoping that somehow you are circling towards each other rather than away. This is where the real erosion happens. And there are no easy answers.

## Opposing Mountains
But to heal our mountains. We have to circle their bases. Sometimes take their paths. Because that’s what enables us to forge new routes. Live those counter arguments.

That’s why our biggest healing often happens through meeting our opposite. The person who naturally finds it hard to give what we seek to heal. 

Anxious meets avoidant. Unworthy meets incapable. Controlling meets submissive.

And it can be a gift or a curse. Or both depending on the relationship.

But true, deep healing comes from acceptance. From someone seeing the beautiful, messed up human being that we are. And loving us anyway. And that person caring enough. Being driven enough. To overcome their own mountains. Just to love us that little bit better each day. 

# Holding Patterns
But as we've seen, healing isn’t a given in a relationship. Our protective structures can make relationship patterns stable. Often at the expense of erosion.

## Careful Distance
Your partner forgot to take the bin out. Yet again. It riles you up a little bit. Not enough to start a real fight. But you still can’t help but make a sarcastic comment. “I’ll take the bins out myself then shall I?”. They look at you. They know exactly what you meant. So they answer you back. “Well, I did walk the dog twice today. How many times did you do it?”

You want to say more. But you know it’s best to leave it. You said your piece. Made your point the only way you know how. Neither of you have ever worked out how to do this. How to feel heard in this situation. Nothing you’ve tried has ever worked. 

You could tell the truth. That it made you feel uncared for. But that would hit their mountain. About not being good enough. They would get defensive. Which would’ve sent you further up your mountain. Then it would have escalated.

You both know the game. And the moves by now. 

Over time you’re drifting further apart. You still love them. But they feel so far away sometimes.

## Oscillating Closeness 
Some couples find stability through intense cycles.

You’re very, very deeply in love. So is your partner. But you can’t seem to make it work. You seem to constantly trigger each other. So your relationship has become a battle ground. Sometimes you can’t help but think. Maybe it’s just a trauma bond these days. 

After a particularly bad argument you break up. Again. Maybe you have to finally accept they aren’t the one for you. Because you just can’t find any way to make this work. You wish you could. But it’s too hard. You can’t keep living like this. 

You spend some time apart. It hurts. You just want to call them. Get back together. All your paths still lead to them. But you can’t take the pain of the relationship anymore. So instead, you’re living in a daze. Trying to find new paths. Putting yourself out there. Maybe if you force yourself to keep going. The right pathway will appear. The one that will finally lead you away from all this pain. 

But then a video comes up on tiktok. About love. About how hard it is. But that it’s worth it. You’ve been so unhappy without them. Maybe the video is right. Love is worth it. You don’t want to get hurt again. But you miss them. Later that night you text them casually. You just want to know if they are still there. 

Before you know it, you’re back together. Rolling down those hills all over again. The descent is carved deep into the landscape by now. The gravity makes it feel right. Somehow even better than that first time. Like it’s just meant to be. It was silly to think you could ever live without them. 

You’ve tried so many different things. Through the multiple breakups. Maybe you’ve tried dating others. You’ve tried focusing on work. You’ve tried to find yourself. But in the end. All these new paths just cycle back round. They always lead to this person. The one who can always give you that instant rush. The intensity of falling into the valleys bound together. 

Maybe this is true love trying to find a way. Maybe it’s just dysfunction. You just don’t know. It would be easier if someone just told you.

# False Erosion 
It’s not just relationships we lie to ourselves about. 

Often when we believe we’re becoming a better person. That we are healing. It’s actually just another form of avoidance.

The brain is a master of avoidance. So when we realise our protective structures are maladaptive. What are we going to do? Are we going to heal? Or will we just build a brand new, more sophisticated bypass? 

One that makes us feel superior to all the others who are still blindly crawling around on the floor.

When actually in reality. All we’ve done. Is built a structure upon a structure. We’ve just got better at hiding it. And now, ironically, we’re even further away from healing. 


## Reassurance Seeking
You’ve read the books. Been to therapy. Done the work. Learnt to be brave and communicate your needs. Even if they aren’t always well received. You are doing what is right for you.

So it’s friday night. Your partner wants to go out with their friends. You can feel your abandonment fear creeping in. But that’s ok. You understand what to do. You just need to name it. You say to your partner. “I’m feeling really anxious about you going out. Can we just talk through my feelings first? Then you can go out.” 

You feel mature. You finally feel like you are growing. Learning to take up some space. You’ve learnt to explain your anxiety. And how it connects to your childhood wounds. 

You just need some reassurance to help with your anxiety. It’s asking for what you need. Exactly what you’re meant to do. But by the time you feel calm. They say they can’t be bothered to go out now.

They do seem a bit frustrated. You can understand that. But you’re their partner. They should want to care for you when you’re struggling. You’re just sharing your needs. What you don’t realise. Is that expressing your needs has just become a new, more enlightened form of control. 

## Being Upfront 
Maybe you have completely mapped out your own patterns. You’ve learnt to accept you are flawed, and that’s ok. It’s taken a lot of work.

You meet someone new. It's only fair you tell them about yourself up front. "I have anxiety issues. Sometimes I need extra support. If this is too much for you, I understand". You're being clear aren't you. You need someone who can handle you. This way you know the relationship works for both of you. Before you get too invested.

On your 5th date. Their mum calls. They look stressed. They say “I’m sorry this is really important. I need to go. I’m so sorry.” You don’t like it. If it’s not their mum it's their best friend. Or their niece. There’s always someone more important than you. You just want to feel important to your partner. It’s a familiar hurt. Because it reminds you of your emotionally distant mother always prioritising your sister. 

It’s time to stand your ground isn’t it. If they can’t prioritise you now when will they ever be able to. You are clear. You are being boundaried. “I told you this up front. You knew what you were getting into. But if I am too much for you. We’d just better end it now”. 

Now they are trapped between a rock and a hard place. Your upfront declaration has worked. You have silenced them. The relationship now runs on your terms.

## Codependence Boundary
You know all about codependence. You’ve been there. Bought the t-shirt. And you know it’s not healthy.

Partners in the past always expected too much. For you to take care of their emotions.

To come running whenever they called. They had issues. They needed to learn independence. They always wanted to change you. Never again. 

You’ve told your new partner that sometimes you need space. Sometimes you get overwhelmed and just need some time to yourself. They seemed to accept it. They said they understood. They came across reasonable at the time.

But then, in an argument. They bring it up. Hold it against you. And it triggers something in you. 

You are really trying to be a good partner in this relationship. But sometimes you push way beyond your comfort level. And they just don’t seem to get it. They don’t appreciate your efforts. 

Sometimes they message you too much. You force yourself to reply, just so you don’t hurt their feelings. Sometimes they want to cuddle too much. You do it. Even though it’s way beyond your comfort level. You don’t want to hurt their feelings. But it’s smothering.

Can they not see how hard you are trying? It’s exhausting. You just need some space before you blow. This is for their sake too. You don’t want to hurt them. They need to understand you cannot meet all their needs. They are becoming codependent. And it’s not healthy. 

You start carving out a bit more space. You’re not trying to be mean. You want this relationship to work. You want it to be healthy. 

But they sense the distance. Even though you’ve been so careful to hide it. You don’t want to hurt their feelings. But this is just more evidence. They’re too focused on you. They need to focus on themselves. On their own independence.

Next time you see them. They try to bring it up. You shut it down. “Healthy relationships require space. Maybe you should see a therapist about why you need so much external validation”.

You mean it. You really do want this relationship to work. You need them to be healthier. Anyone would feel suffocated with what they are asking for. 

Your core belief. That you aren’t capable of intimate relationships has turned into a hard boundary. A rule your partner has no choice but to learn to follow. Neither of you are healing. Just avoiding. 

## Labeller
Maybe you really understand human behaviour. You can see every one of your partners' mountains in real time. You see all the work they need to do. And you want to help them. It’s not just for you. They would be happier too. So every time you see them acting out of insecurity you tell them. In a very supportive and caring way.

And they hear it. They acknowledge what you’re saying. They can see it too. They understand it intellectually. But it doesn't seem to be helping. They are still repeating the same patterns. Over and over. 

The issue is, you can’t heal mountains intellectually. And every time you point out their insecurity, you’re just triggering it. With pinpoint accuracy. And well, you know, that’s got to hurt.

And sometimes. They have just had a long day at work. Their mood isn't caused by their father's abandonment. It's just been a long day.

## Understanding
Even being the understanding, accommodating partner can be a form of avoidance. Maybe you believe you are unworthy of true love. You think you can only be accepted if you hide parts of yourself. That you are, simply, too much to expect people to be able to cope with.

And maybe your partner has a core belief of their own. That they are unable to love fully. That some part of them is broken. But you see them clearly. You understand them. They’re doing their best. It’s just their trauma, their upbringing, their insecurities speaking. So you are always accommodating towards them. Because you know it’s not their fault. 

But this understanding comes at a cost. It’s strengthening your own mountains. It's confirming that there are parts of you that need to be hidden away.

And you aren't helping with their mountains either. They can see they’re hurting you. That you’re trying desperately to be ok. When you’re not. So they are learning a lesson of their own. For them to be loved, their partner must be in pain. That loving them means coping with their inadequacies. And that just confirms their deepest fear. That some part of them is broken.

## Wrong Mountains
Maybe you think you know your mountains. But you haven't gone deep enough.

You think you know the problem. People don’t listen to you. It happens all the time. And it feels horrible. Hard to sit with. So this must be the mountain. Your core belief must be, “I don’t deserve to be heard.” It all makes perfect sense.

It happens everywhere. You tell your partner about your day. They just scroll on their phone. You share your ideas at work. People just talk over you. Even your friends can’t seem to listen.

So you work on a solution. You speak more assertively. You set boundaries about being interrupted. You tell your partner. “When you don’t listen to me. It really hurts. I need to feel heard in this relationship”

But somehow it gets worse. The more you demand attention. The more people stop listening. Your partner says you’re exhausting. That you always need validation. That you always steer the conversation back to yourself.

You’re confused. Aren’t you just asking for basic respect? To be heard? How can that be too much?  

But your mountain isn’t “I deserve to be heard”. It’s ”I have no worth”. It’s buried down much, much deeper. 

And every time someone doesn’t listen. It triggers your mountain. It confirms you’re worthless. 

So you built a protective structure. A boundary around being heard. But when people push back against that boundary, they aren’t just questioning the structure. They’re knocking it up against your real mountain.

And the hard truth is. You do exhaust people with your protective structure. You do always steer conversations back to you. But now people’s natural reactions hit you exactly where it hurts the most. 

# Author's Note
I’m sure many people will want me to carry on writing. To turn this into a self help guide. “10 Easy Steps to Identify Your Mountains”. But that would be disingenuous. There are no easy answers. 

I believe we have to look deep within ourselves to find what is true. Which are our best paths. But this is hard. There's so much noise. What our partner says. What our parents say. What our friends say. What our therapist says. What society says. And maybe loudest of all, what our mountains say. Deciphering the best direction to head is an almost impossible task. Especially when so many of them have their own agendas which may not align with what is best for us.

It's important to remember that we all have our own landscapes. We can’t prescribe the perfect cure for someone else. As one person’s erosion is another person’s avoidance. We should also never judge another person’s landscape. As we can never know the mountains they have and which paths are available. 

My only hope is that this framework offers a new perspective. Maybe a bit more clarity to see your own patterns. And the patterns and actions of others in your life. And maybe over time, that frees up a small amount of energy to start making slightly different choices. And maybe the first set of choices don’t work. But maybe the 6th set does. 

There are no simple solutions. Understanding doesn’t mean always empathising with others. Nor does it mean always setting boundaries. From my experience, the brain has an amazing ability to misdirect us from looking at what we really need to see. Because that’s how it learnt to keep us safe. Our mountains, however badly optimised they look from the outside, were the best solution our brains found at the time they were formed. They were made to keep us safe.

 However our brain also deeply wants to heal. But I've found the biggest sign of healing isn’t mastering techniques. It’s when you’ve realised you’ve stopped calculating the optimum way to be loved or to be appreciated. And learnt to just live.

Which is a lot easier said than done. Especially when the modern world is so damaging.
