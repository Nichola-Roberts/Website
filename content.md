You know the feeling. You just got home from work. It’s been a long, hard day. You collapse on the sofa. You don’t have the energy for anything. You know you have to cook dinner, to do your washing. But you can’t. You can’t even begin to think about doing them. Because you’re completely out of energy. 

You’re sitting there, trying to block out your thoughts, trying to focus on the tv. But your partner comes over and asks you how your day was. You snap at them. You don’t mean to. But replying is impossible. Your brain just wants to shut down. You don’t have the energy.

When you start looking at life from this perspective. That you have a mental energy limit that you can’t push beyond. Things start making a lot more sense. 

# Energy Landscape
Imagine you’re a ball, standing on a path in front of a vast landscape. There are hills, mountains and valleys. There are paths running everywhere. You see them tracing down the valleys. Winding round the mountains. Branching out. Joining back together. 

These paths represent all the actions you could take. From changing the show on netflix to hanging up the washing. Some paths stretch out far into the distance. For instance, you can just about make out that old pathway. The one you used to dream of. Quitting your job and retraining to follow your passion. But it seems so far away these days.

The valleys are the experiences that feel good. The simplicity of a hot bath. A holiday with your family. Or meeting someone and falling in love. 

The mountains feel huge. They’re stressful to even think about. Filling out important application forms. Not being able to afford your rent. Or the dread of having to face your controlling boss tomorrow. That one's a well-worn path you're forced to take, again and again.  You just know he is going to be unhappy with you. Because he always is. 

Mountains can also represent things that should be easy. Things you’re meant to enjoy. Like a loving conversation with your partner. Some days even that feels uphill.  

You can feel the pull of gravity drawing you down the valleys. And the effort of climbing the mountains. You know which paths you want to take. Which ones slope down. You don’t have to map them out. 

# Fluctuations
Our landscapes fluctuate constantly. The ground is always shifting around us and below us. Sometimes small shifts, sometimes monumental. 

Little events can have dramatic consequences. For instance, an unexpected bill arrives in the post. And suddenly, you're halfway up a mountain that wasn’t there before.

Or one dodgy look from a colleague. And instantly your anxiety rises. Your work task now feels impossible. Two seconds ago you were fine. Now you can’t focus. You can’t think straight. You no longer have the spare energy. A mountain has formed beneath your feet.

Luckily a work friend walks past. She notices you’re stressed. And she’s kind enough to listen intently as you talk it through. Now you’re feeling calmer. So you can think more clearly. You realise it was probably just your paranoia anyway. The mountain subsides. And you can concentrate on work again. Phew. 

Now imagine you’re a teenager instead. Full of life and feeling excited. You're about to go play football with your friends. However. Just as you’re walking out the door. Your mum shouts your name. She thinks you wound up your brother on purpose. And suddenly you start feeling stressed. It’s awful. But now you can’t go out. You can’t muster up any energy anymore. You just want to go to your bedroom. To be alone. A mountain has formed. 

Maybe you could flatten this mountain. Maybe you could defend yourself. Maybe your mum might be reasonable. Then you can calm down. And go out. Or maybe. Maybe arguing back might trigger one of her mountains. Lead to an escalation. Even more stress. And probably extra punishment. It’s not worth the risk. It’s better to hide your bedroom. 

Our landscapes are always changing and fluctuating. Often because of other people. Based on circumstances we don't know. And things we don't understand and can't control. It's chaotic, and often seemingly random like the butterfly effect. 

# Energy Limit
These fluctuations. Sometimes they throw us right up our mountains unexpectedly. 

These are the moments when life has pushed us too far. When everything feels impossibly hard. When we can feel our heartbeat thud. The anxiety rising in our chest. When it feels too much to bear. Like we are about to blow. This is our energy limit. When we hit it we lose our ability to think. And to do pretty much anything.  Except feel stressed. All our mental energy is taken up just trying to survive the moment.

Take this example. Your child goes missing at the park. A random fluctuation. But it's devastating to your system. You feel absolute panic. Instantly taken to your energy limit. Suddenly the only thing that matters is finding them. You've shifted to survival mode. All you care about is this one task. Finding your child. You’re hypervigilant. Even your partner's affair slips your mind. You scan the park. Focusing on any clues you can spot... Oh, wait. There they are. Everything is fine again. That’s a relief. Slowly the mountain starts to subside.

Or maybe you just had a job interview. And you didn’t get the job. You really wanted it, it felt perfect for you. You can't think straight. Now your thoughts are spiraling out of control in your mind. Your anxiety is peaking. You're trapped up at your energy limit unable to escape your thoughts. 

You really need to get your act together. Everyone is going to think you’re a failure if you keep getting rejected from these jobs. Your mind goes over all the stupid things you said. Like laughing at their jokes too hard. It came across as desperate didn’t it. And that awful answer. Why did you not think. You did a whole project on that last year. How could you not remember. You really will never find a job if you keep being this stupid in interviews. You’re sitting there ruminating. You’re meant to take your partner shopping. But how can you now. You can’t bear to leave the house. You don’t want to have to face the real world.

This is when you might snap at your partner. They ask how you are. And in theory you could have been nice to them. Apparently being nice costs nothing. But in this moment it feels beyond your abilities. You have no energy left to formulate a nice reply. 

At least snapping means the conversation is over. And they leave you alone for the rest of the night. It’s not that you don’t care about them. You do love them. Your brain’s just doing its best. It only has limited energy.

Sometimes we quickly return to our baseline. Like when we spotted our child and we relaxed. We gave them a hug. And then sat back down on the bench. We could feel our heart rate return to normal. And thoughts of the affair creep back into our mind.

Sometimes, however, it can last weeks. Like when we were worried about being a failure for not having a job. We can get stuck in our thoughts. And while we can distract ourselves or block it out. The mountain is there still. Just below our awareness. Vulnerable to any little knocks. Triggering us. Making it too big to carry on ignoring.

Understanding this helps explain why we're not lazy or mean. We're just working within our limited energy budget. This energy limit is relatively fixed. A height in our landscape we cannot go above.

Over time we learn to anticipate this height. And we become protective over it. We learn to avoid the dangerous paths. The events. The conversations. The risks. The things that could suddenly fluctuate and blow everything up.

# Planning 
Sometimes we can look out at our landscape and contemplate our paths. Maybe we can map them all out clearly. And choose with a clear head. We can calmly decide some risks aren't worth taking, no matter how big the reward might be. Or sometimes we might decide they are. 

But some paths. They feel scary. We don't want to even look at them. To acknowledge they exist. Like the test next week. Or making that hospital appointment we know we need. 

And this gets even harder when we are stressed. We can't plan our way out. It’s like a mountain fog blocks the paths we could take. So we can’t see them any more.

Take this example. 

Your dad died 6 months ago. It still feels awful. On top of that you hate your job. Two huge mountains. Intersecting below your feet. Holding you up at your energy limit.

Every day feels endless. There really is no end in sight. How can you even begin to feel better? You can’t. You’re just surviving. Trying to get through the next 5 minutes. High up on these mountains, right at your limit.

You’ve managed to carve yourself a little pocket. In bed, at 10am. Where you can just about breathe. Barely. But it still feels like relief. You can hide there for the moment. But all around you. In every direction, the landscape rises up. The paths go beyond your energy limit. Every task feels beyond your capabilities. 

Making a coffee is too much. Replying to a message, it’s too much. Getting out of bed, too much. You’re completely overwhelmed all the time. It’s uncomfortable to think about these tasks. To even glance at their paths. You just want to stay in your pocket.

And if you can’t even make coffee, how can you plan your way down the mountain? You feel absolutely trapped. You can’t face thinking about anything. You literally cannot even see the paths out. Even if others point them out. They stay purely theoretical. Not things you could actually do.

Now, instead. Imagine you have to make a presentation for your course. The path is obvious. Just start working. But every time you try to think about it, it feels too much. You immediately get stressed. Actually opening the laptop and starting on it. Well that’s impossible. 

You know the consequences. You just can’t make yourself do it. You know it’s procrastination. But what can you do? You always leave it to the last minute. But somehow it just seems to work. 

The days creep by. And lo and behold. Suddenly the day before it’s due you feel the focus coming. Just like you knew it would. A new mountain is rising quickly beneath your feet. You start to feel the inevitable stress of not finishing in time. And suddenly the consequences feel very real. You will fail your course if you don’t start right now. Right at this very moment. So quick, get the laptop. Get on that path.

The mountain you felt about starting is now eclipsed by a bigger, much more imposing mountain. This one represents failing your course. It’s taking you up high, right up to your energy limit. But it doesn’t feel like panic. It feels like focus. It’s shutting down your other thoughts. You’re entering fight or flight. All just to create a presentation. 

When we most need to plan our way out. When we're stuck in pain or desperation. Or facing a deadline. That's when the fog is thickest. The paths that seem so obvious to others aren't just hidden. It's like they don't exist.

# Relationships
But life isn't only full of climbing mountains. There are also the valleys. The moments that make it all worthwhile. Like falling in love.

Everyone knows the new relationship feeling. You feel happy, blissful even. The world feels new, and full of fresh opportunities. Maybe last week it was hard to get out of bed. But now everything has a purpose. Your whole landscape has shifted. You’ve rolled into a new valley you’ve never been to before. And suddenly everything looks different, much brighter. You feel like a whole new person. 

And it continues. Day after day. You feel the rush of energy as you roll down the slope. Gaining momentum. You can’t stop. Even if you wanted to. And there’s no way you want to. 

Your old problems don’t seem important. Your work day is as dull as ever. But it’s ok. Your mind is just fantasising about tonight. You can already picture telling your partner about that colleague's dodgy look. They’ll love the story. I mean what an idiot. Who does he think he is. He really needs to get a life and stop being obsessed with you.

Having someone reliably there for you changes everything. Someone you trust to listen to you and validate you as you share your life. It gives you a sense of home and safety. 

Over time you stay in this lower energy state. But it starts to feel normal. Your new baseline. This new landscape has mountains too. But they’re different mountains. You have more free energy. You can take bigger risks, make big life changes. Maybe decide to stand up for yourself. Like stop talking to your emotionally abusive father. Once and for all.

But unfortunately life also has heartbreaks. Your partner could call things off. And suddenly you’re half way up a mountain again. Without an easy path to get down. 

To make matters worse. Your dad calls when you're feeling particularly sad. He knew you would never be able to hold on to someone so great. What a mess. He was rude to you. And you just took it. Like the old days. Why did you let him say that to you?  Why did you not stand up for yourself?

# Emotions

## Navigating 
Our emotions are the signals that tell us about the landscape. They're the clues to the gradient of the slope. Whether we’re heading up a mountain or down into a valley. Each emotion is a cocktail of brain chemicals with a crucial message. Take this path and avoid that one.

We feel happy when we are travelling down. And when we're going up, our body screams to us that we’re going the wrong way.

## Learning
Emotions don't just guide us. They update the landscape itself. Every outcome is fed back into the system. Which is constantly being re-mapped to become a more accurate model of reality. This is how we learn. The emotional data tells us which paths to reinforce, and which ones lead to catastrophic mistakes.

It could be as simple as getting a free cake with your coffee order. It’s amazing. You update your landscape. And just like that. There’s a new downward path leading right back to their doorway. 

Or the update could be something big and awful. Like you saw your ex with their new partner at the park. A huge mountain forms. Right over the top of that park. You’re never ever gonna go there again.

Sometimes we’re too stressed, or too busy to process the emotions in the moment. So we mark off a huge area with warning barriers. This is a temporary fix. But we can come back to it later. When it’s safer. Then we can start to sift through what happened, to process the emotions and properly map the terrain.

So that evening, after seeing your ex, your mind drifts. You can feel the emotions all over again. You really just hate them. They broke your heart. 

But wait a minute. Actually. Now you’re thinking about it. It doesn’t feel as bad as you thought. The breakup was 8 months ago. And you had that really nice first date last week. Maybe you could risk the park. Oh no. That still hurts. You definitely can’t. But still, it’s good to notice you’ve made a small amount of progress. Maybe one day you’ll be ok.

Sometimes emotions reinforce what we already know. And sometimes they reshape our landscape completely. 

You find an incredible Thai restaurant. That first curry feels so amazing. You spend all week thinking about it. Telling everyone who will listen. You’re so excited to go back. You’re actively updating your landscape, to include this restaurant. And it feels kind of exhilarating.

Then three months later. You order the same curry. It still tastes exactly the same. It’s still amazing. But it's become normal. The emotions have been processed. The paths mapped. So there’s no need for the intensity anymore.

# Emotional Overload
Updating the landscape requires processing our emotions. But this means feeling it all. All over again. And that takes energy. A lot of energy if the experience was stressful. And when you're at your limit, that’s energy you just don't have.

## Everyday Overload
Imagine, you're having a fight with your partner. They keep going on. Point after point. Each one is an accusation you have to process. A defense you have to form. You can't think. Your brain is overloaded. You just need it to stop.

You say you need space. They don't listen. They keep going on. You shut down. You can't even hear them anymore. They are just noise. Deafening noise. Internally you are begging for them to stop. You just can't bear it.

The next day they say sorry. They want to talk it over. But you can't. You’ve blocked it out. Marked it off with warning barriers. You want to move on and forget about the whole thing. Pretend it never happened. 

## Trauma
You’re a child. You just fell over, and you’ve really hurt your leg. You start crying. And your mum shouts at you for exaggerating. But you’re not. You can barely walk. Your mum's stressed. She has an important meeting at work and she’s running late taking you to school. It’s her fault though. She lost the house keys. But anyway. She does try. She’s just very stressed. 

You try to walk. But oh my god does it hurt. You keep going. But you're limping along very slowly. You can tell your mum is annoyed. She stares you straight in the eyes, and tells you “*We don’t have time for this. Get yourself together. Why can’t you just be normal for once. Sometimes I wish I’d never had children*” Now that one really, really does hurt. Ouch. 

You fall to the floor in a ball. You can barely breathe. You feel so upset. So so upset. But now your mum is even more annoyed. She needs to get to work. So she drags you up by your arm. 

So there you are, getting dragged along. You’re still upset. But you have no choice. Sitting on the floor feeling sorry for yourself made it worse. So you have to keep going. But now you’re more detached. Thinking what you can do to make this ok? Crying doesn’t help. Feeling sorry for yourself doesn’t help. You just need to shut off these emotions somehow. Stop listening to them. They’re not doing you any good. She treats you worse when she can see your emotions. 

You finally get to school. You still can’t concentrate. People try to talk to you all day. But you can barely hear them. You just need to get through the day. But why. What’s better about being at home. Your life is one bad situation after another. A mountain range of trauma. 

There’s no one to make you feel safe. No one to tell you it wasn’t your fault. So you cry alone in bed that night. Blaming yourself, if only you could be a better child, then maybe your mum would love you better, take care of you better. Maybe you wouldn’t be a burden to her life and she wouldn’t regret your existence.

These unprocessed emotions don't disappear or even fade away. They become mountains we've never fully mapped. They're cordoned off with a wide no go area. Sometimes it's temporary. Just a stressful day we'll process next week when the stress has passed. But sometimes the experience was too big. And our baseline stress too high. So we never have the excess energy to relive the emotions and begin to process. The cordons become a permanent feature.

# Core Beliefs
And this is how core beliefs are formed. Often in childhood. Extreme moments that shape our landscape profoundly. These mountains will remain for much of our lives. 

That child had no other options. Their survival depended on their mum. And they learned their landscape. Telling their mum how they felt was a path that only made things worse.

Making themselves small kept them safe. It’s backwards, but, to be cared for the child had to act like their existence was a burden. Because then, sometimes, on her good days, that allowed their mum to have the energy to care for them.

This was the most accurate map they had. The only landscape that worked.

In adulthood we are so used to the presence of these mountains that we barely notice them. 

No. Actually. We do notice them. They’re there in our every action. In our every decision. We navigate our daily lives around them. We just don’t really think about them. 

Because they’re our mountains. Our biggest insecurities. Our deepest fears. They are stressful and painful to think about. So we just don’t. But they are still there. Lurking. They’re the “truths” that we map our daily lives around. 

## “I’m worthless”
“I’m worthless” Believes the adult who was told they were a waste of space. 

They don’t dare hope someone might do them a kind deed. Or forgive them for a mistake. They’re always careful. Making sure they never put upon others. Why ask for anything when you know you’re worth nothing. They don’t want to put others in an awkward situation. Don’t want to force them to have to say the truth out loud. They don’t want the hurt of having that pointed out. Yet again. 

## “I’m a failure”
Another child might have been taught “You’re a failure” at school. 

They noticed they were always the last to finish their work. Or the teacher came to check on them more than the others. As they got older they struggled with tests and exams. I mean it’s obvious isn’t it, they just aren’t that clever. When they grew up, they also failed job interviews. They finally got a job at a supermarket. But then it closed down.

Now they go to the job centre. And oh my god is it stressful. It’s so hard for them to think about getting another job. They go to so many interviews. And in every one, they have to face the interviewer. Look them in the eye. And all they can think is, they see it too. They see the failure. They are wondering why this person even bothered showing up. Why would anyone hire them?

## "I'm Too Much"
Another child was taught their feelings were too much. When they cried they were told to grow up. When they were excited, they were told to calm down. They learned that their emotions were a dangerous force that pushed people away. 

As an adult, their relationships are filled with anxiety. They’re terrified that if their partner sees their true feelings they will leave. So they try to hold them in. But they can’t. The feelings are too big. And when they finally burst out, they can feel themselves being "too much." And they hate themselves for it.

## “Other People Are More Important"
Sometimes a child will learn they need to prioritise others over themself.

When their parent is always overwhelmed no one takes care of them. No one cooks dinner. No one washes their clothes. They always get shouted at. 

So they learn to calm their parent. Remove their stresses. Do the washing themselves. Take care of the other children. Become their emotional sounding board. Only then does their parent become ok. Becomes fun to be around. Caring. Loving. Everything they want.

So the child learns to watch the emotions of others. And it carries on into adulthood. They see it as their job to make sure everyone else is ok. When a friend is sad, they feel sad. And it feels worse than if it was their own emotion. When their partner is stressed, they need to fix it. They don’t feel any peace until everyone else is ok first. 

## “I’m on My Own”
Someone else had a single parent who never had the time to help. They were working two jobs, and were always stressed. When they needed help tying their shoelaces, their mum was too busy. When they needed help with their maths homework, their mum was too busy. When they were being bullied and needed support, their mum was too busy. 

They learnt “I Am on My Own”. So as an adult at work they can’t ask for help. They get in trouble for failing to do tasks. But they still can’t bring themselves to ask for help. When they’re at home their partner asks them how they are. They say I’m fine. What else are they meant to do. They don’t want to burden their partner with the reality of who they are.

## "I Can't Trust Anyone"
This child was hurt time after time. Their dad was violent. Their mum a drug addict who barely came home. Their grandma punished them for every little thing. Their teacher thought they cried too much. And punishing them for not concentrating was the solution. 

They kept trying new tactics. If I'm nicer to my grandma, maybe she will be kinder. But nothing ever worked.

They kept hoping the next person would be different. But their new friend just told everyone their secrets. And then stopped talking to them.

Every false hope caused the final betrayal to hurt even more.

So they learnt vulnerability was a weakness. It would always get them hurt. 

As an adult they never trust anyone. They never truly let anyone in. Even when they want to. Because that’s the trick. That’s when they get hurt the most. In a world where you can’t trust anyone. You have to be smart. You have to play the system. Learn to get what you need. Without risking a thing.

## “Don’t Trust Reality”
Another child has their reality dismissed. 

Maybe their mum forgot their birthday. They casually mentioned it to her on the day. And their mum even said sorry.

But then a week later. She said she didn’t forget. That she got them a present. It was confusing. The child knows it didn’t happen. Or they think they know. They can’t find any evidence of a present anyway. Maybe they lost it. They don’t think they got one. But their mum seems so sure.

Their mum makes them perform the lie. Makes them say thank you.  It’s getting more confusing. What’s the truth? But the child knows it deep down. They just aren’t allowed to think it anymore. It gets buried down deep inside. And a false narrative lives over the surface.

These are just some of the mountains that could have formed. Each person's landscape is unique. Someone could have one core belief. Someone else could have several, all interlinking.

# Triggers
The more mountains someone has the higher their baseline stress. When your landscape’s full of mountains you’re always on high alert. You’re extra vigilant. Those natural fluctuations feel dangerous. Any one of them could trigger you. And you’ll be right up that mountain. So you have to be careful all the time. Particularly around your core beliefs. And the sad thing is. Your optimum path. The steepest downward path is often hidden behind the mountains. So you keep bumping into them. 

Let me demonstrate through the two most talked about opposing romantic scenarios.

## “They’ll see who I really Am”
You just met someone perfect. But that’s what’s scary. No way would someone perfect waste their time with you. They just don’t know you yet. They can’t see who you really are. They can’t see that you’re damaged. That you're emotionally inadequate. The dark truth you carry around with you. 

Of course they aren’t going to stick around for that.

But they’re your steepest gradient. Everything is pulling you towards them. You want to go to them. But you can’t help but feel the inevitable doom. Someone else could just roll down this hill. They’d be happy. Enjoying their new landscape. But you can feel the mountain creeping up on you. 

Now you think about it. You’re actually barely coping. Why are you not feeling happy anymore. This is what you always wanted? Isn’t it? Maybe they aren’t right for you after all. If this was real love you’d know wouldn’t you. There wouldn’t be any doubts. The more you think. The more the mountain rises. You can’t feel the downward slope anymore. 

The next date they seem way too into you. They got you a gift. They’re moving too fast. They’ve obviously got issues. This is awkward. The pressure is rising in you. You’ll just hurt them more the longer you leave it. It’s better if you just break up with them now. No. It’s too hard right now. You’ll send them a text later. You didn’t like their hairstyle anyway. It’s not a great loss. You’ve found your path down. It’s just down the mountain. Not down the valley.

## “I’m about to be abandoned"
Your partner hasn’t replied to your text for two hours. It feels like the end of the world. You are about to be abandoned. You can just sense it. 

You’re painfully aware of your mountain. You feel like you are too much. You know you keep pushing people away at times like this. This is why people abandon you. This is why this person is abandoning you.

But the feeling of waiting to find out is unbearable. You literally cannot sit with it. You need to know right now. Have I been abandoned? You call them. They don’t answer. You knew it. You call them again. No answer. You’re in absolute panic. You need this to be over. Then at least you can start packing your bags, and face the reality of starting all over again. It's best to know. 

The phone rings.

It’s your partner. They are very sorry. They left their phone in a taxi. They finally got it back. They want to know if you are ok. They know you get anxious sometimes. 

Phew. It was just a random fluctuation in the landscape after all. 

These repeated experiences reinforce our mountains. Turning them into mountain ranges of connecting peaks, all circling around the same dark “truth”.

# Emergency Escape Routes 
When you’re up a mountain. Stressed out of your mind. It feels unbearable. You can’t sit with it. You can’t wait until you calm down. It’s killing you. You need to get down. Right now. This very second. 

Your brain’s in crisis. You have no ability to plan ahead. To consider the longer term consequences. To think through the best path. You just need to take the fastest path down. Right now.

This is when we use our emergency exit strategies. The moments in our lives we are probably the least proud of. The ones that fill us with a sense of shame when we look back at them. Everyone has their own set. Heavily dependent on what worked in childhood. 

## Control 
As a child you were neglected. Your parents never had time for you. The only time you got any attention was when you were causing trouble. 

And yes, your parents were angry. But at least in that moment they remembered you existed. You impacted the world. Your brother got told not to wind you up. To let you play on the console. Even though it wasn’t your turn. It was your little glimpse of what love feels like. What it means to feel important.

As you get older, you learn other people can be manoeuvred. And this helps you regulate when you are stressed out. Let’s imagine you have a core belief. “I will never be enough”.

Your partner wants to go out to the pub with her friends. The panic starts. All the potential scenarios are playing through your mind. She’s laughing at you with her friends, talking about how you failed her yesterday and she's thinking of leaving you. 

You can picture it now.  Someone’s hitting on her. She’s weighing up her options. You can just tell she won’t be coming home tonight. She’ll be staying with him. Oh actually. You’ve just remembered. The new guy at work. She thinks his jokes are funny. It drives you mad.

The thoughts are getting too much to bear. You don’t want to be this person. You want to be a good partner. You try to think rationally. But it’s not working. You can’t live in this state. What can you do. She shouldn’t be making you feel this way.

If she cared she wouldn’t want you to be this distressed. Really you are just asking for what you deserve. You should call her and ask her to come home. 

You could ask her nicely. But what if she says no. Last time you were upset she said no. And it hurt. Even more than it’s hurting now. It proved how little she did actually care. You can’t take that risk again. You need a guarantee.

You pick up the phone. “How dare you go out and flirt with him. Do you not care about me? You need to come home right now. Or I don’t know what I will do.”

Your mountain has gone, she is coming home. None of these imaginary scenarios can happen. She will be at home with you. However, she now has a brand new mountain in her landscape. She is feeling like she can’t go to the pub with her friends anymore. 

Over time your landscape has become manageable. She knows you just can’t cope with certain things. She’s learnt to care about you better. To not trigger you so much. But. Little do you know. She’s just learnt to walk on eggshells. To preempt anything that might set you off. Her landscape is full of new mountains. “I can’t see my friends”, “I can’t stand up for myself”, “I can’t think about my own needs”. You feel calm. But she feels trapped.

Control is just one kind of exit strategy. There are many others. Some are quiet and turned inwards. Some are loud and aimed at others.

## Distraction
You might have learnt to ignore your emotions. You block them out through compartmentalisation. You distance yourself with logical dissection. You learn to distract yourself with exercise, shopping, food, or self-harm. You scroll endlessly on TikTok. Or you learn to suppress the feeling directly, with drugs or alcohol.

## Desperation
Instead. You might have learnt to make your emotions so loud they are impossible for others to ignore. You might beg and plead when you fear abandonment. “Please, I can’t cope without you”. “I don’t know what I would do if you left”. You feel so desperate. If they could see how deeply you were hurting. Maybe then they would help you down your mountain. 

## Manipulative
You might have learnt the world doesn’t listen to your truth. Your partner wants to go away for the weekend with their family. You can already feel your abandonment mountain creeping in. You know what would happen if you asked them not to go. There would just be an argument. And they would probably still go anyway. So. So you tell them you have a sudden medical appointment. You tell them you need their support. That you're worried.. It's slightly true. It's 3 weeks away. You do feel bad. But the guilt is manageable. At least you can sit with the guilt. You can't sit with abandonment.

## Devaluation 
Imagine your partner is having a go at you. Going on and on. You didn’t want to go to their work event. Now they are listing every little thing they have done recently. Honestly it’s getting boring. They chose to do these things. You didn’t ask them to. And they shouldn’t have done them if they were going to hold them against you.

But then all of a sudden. They got a hit on target. Hit a nerve. And suddenly the boredom has gone. And now you need to stop them. You lose your temper. Say something you know will hurt them. Something that will take them down from their high horse. That you were only with them for their money anyway. You feel proud you know this one will hurt.

And it does. Now they are saying they want to break up with you. 

Panic hits. It’s just got serious. It feels unbearable. How could they do this?

It's all because they are selfish and self obsessed. They aren't capable of caring about others. A really bad person. And do you know what? You are better off without them. They were never good enough for you anyway. Really you should have left a long time ago.

Suddenly you don’t feel hurt anymore. How could someone as small as them hurt you? It’s not you that’s flawed. It’s them. 

## Self Sacrifice 
Let’s imagine you were the child who learnt “I am a burden”. You just got bullied at school. You’re relieved to be home. But you're still feeling really upset. It’s hard to get it all off your mind. Your mum gets home from work. She does a double take. She can see you were crying. Oh no. 

Your mum has just worked two shifts. And had an argument with her ex. She looks at you. It sends her even further up her own mountains. This one, in particular, represents her insecurity about being a bad parent. She knows she is failing you. But the thought is too much for her to bear. She snaps. She needs you to be ok. She needs to end the guilt you are creating in her. “Grow up. It’s not the end of the world. I have enough going on already. You'll push me over the edge if you keep this up”

Right. You dry your eyes. You’re just making everything worse. You can see your mum visibly relax. Look. She’s right. You’re fine. You don’t need to ruin everything. Just put it out of your mind. Help her bring the shopping in. That will help her calm down. Maybe she’ll have some time for you later if you help her with her stress. You’ve learnt your only way down your mountain is to block it out. 

If you give endlessly, how could you be a burden? 

This is a strategy you carry into adulthood. If you never ask for anything you can’t be a burden. No one can trigger your core belief. The problem is you’ve expanded its footprint. Now. If someone doesn’t need your help. Then you must be an even bigger burden than you thought. You’re in the way. Even when all you’re trying to do is help. 

Everyone has their own strategies. But one thing is always true. When people feel the unbearable, they will do absolutely anything to get down. To make things worse, these can become their own core beliefs, a new connecting mountain range. Your exit strategy becomes its own mountain. You might learn “I am dangerous”, “I’m an alcoholic”, “I need to lie to be accepted”. 

Now you’re trapped between two mountains. The one you were running from. And the one you built to get away.

## Pushing People Away
When someone else is infringing on your mountains. You might feel an urge to push them away. Snap. Go cold. Stonewall. Distract them by poking at their own mountains. At least this way they will stop. 

# Protective Structures
These emergency exits get us down the mountain. But we still feel the pain. The core belief has still been triggered.

So over time, we learn a new strategy. We learn to stop the triggers before they even hit us. We build rules and systems to keep people away from our mountains. Like bypasses, defensive castle walls and watchtowers. These are our protective structures.

And these structures don't feel like a choice. They feel like a right. And it makes sense. We feel entitled not to be hurt.

## Monitoring 
Imagine you grew up believing “I have no autonomy”. As a child, every decision was made for you.

You were told when to wake up. When to go to school. At school, you were told what to do all day. You got home and had to start your homework. Then you had to start your chores. You weren’t allowed to see your friends. Weren’t allowed on your phone. Weren’t allowed to watch TV. Or listen to music. You weren’t even allowed to choose your own clothes. Or the words that were acceptable to say to your father. It was like your whole life happened to you.

Now as an adult every time you compromise yourself you feel the stabbing pain. The pain of your voice not being enough. The pain of being worth less than someone else’s wishes. The pain of never being considered. And it hurts. A lot. 

You have to find ways to protect yourself. It’s the only way to feel ok in life.

Now you check your partner’s phone constantly. You need to know where they are. Who they’re with. What time they’re coming home. You need to know everything. Not because you don’t trust them. But because their actions impact you. And you don’t want someone having that much control over your life. Not again. It's not asking for much, is it. For them to just stick to the time they agreed to. I mean, they agreed.

Last month they were an hour late. You remember sitting at home. Waiting. Feeling like your life was out of control all over again. You don’t want to control them. You just want control over your own life. 

## Manipulation 
And maybe over time. You learn even that doesn’t work. Maybe you’ve been kind one too many times. But you can see it clearly now. Everyone is playing their own game. Everyone is looking out for themselves. You’ve learnt the world is cruel. And if you don't play the game you lose automatically. 

Your partner wants to go out with their friends. And it would be ok. But not these friends. These friends think you’re bad. But you know what’s really going on. You see through it all. The friends are planting seeds. Suggesting they stand up for themselves more. That they aren’t being treated well. But it’s not fair. Your partner only tells them one side. Not the full story.

Your partner asks if you'd be okay with them going. And no. You're not. But you can see they aren't really listening. They still want to go. You can feel the panic rising. What can you do? Then it pops into your mind. You’re reminded about a comment you overheard recently. About how these friends think your partner talks too much. Well that’s not quite what they said. You've twisted it slightly. You know you have. But it wouldn't work if you didn't.

It slips out before you really think about it. You see your partner’s face drop. And they decide to stay home with you.

Maybe you did lie a little. But everyone does. At least you are protecting yourself. You're not naive. You've been stomped on too many times to play fair.

## Keeping Score
Maybe you have a mountain representing “I have no value”. 

You feel an unbearable emptiness every time someone doesn’t give back equally. It’s the pain of not being appreciated. Not being valuable enough to be treated well. Every time they forget to reciprocate it hurts. 

Last night you listened to your partner talk about work for hours. Tonight you’re a bit upset, but they want to go out with their friends. So you’re left alone with it. You feel the imbalance. And oh my god does it hurt. 

They've also not done the washing up. When it was their turn. And you paid for the last two meals out. The evidence is mounting. They take you for granted. But that’s what people do. You’re the kind of person who gets taken for granted. But inside you remain firm. You deserve better than this. You deserve to be valued. 

So you start keeping a mental scorecard. Maybe a real spreadsheet. Every interaction is weighed up and measured. You can't help it. It's automatic. You start making rules. Bills have to be split exactly. Chores assigned rigidly. Then at least your value feels provable. You are just making absolutely sure you get your worth back.

## Competence
Maybe your worth is tied to your competence.

Maybe as a child your parents didn’t know how to meet you where you were. Didn’t know how to be there when you fell out with your friends. When you failed your spelling test. When you fell over. 

But they were there for gymnastics. This is when you had their attention. You learnt to channel your needs through this lens. When you did well at gymnastics you were loved, you were validated, you had worth. 

Now as an adult, your self-worth is still wrapped up in your achievements. They are the structure you’ve built to hide your mountain. They are propping you up. But the structure barely works. You still feel worthlessness inside.

So you overcompensate. You channel all your energy into achieving even more. You never feel brave enough to pause. To be your true self. Because if you are not your achievements, then who are you?

Or maybe it wasn't sports. Maybe it was your academic achievements. Your parents always praised you when you did well at school.

Now, at work, you’ve just finished a challenging project. You’ve been working on it for months. And you’re proud of what the team has achieved. Your contribution was the most important. Of course. But everyone did well.

At a stakeholder meeting, your colleague answers a question. He explains one of your core ideas, but he doesn't mention your name. You watch the faces in the room light up. They're impressed. It's infuriating. You did that. And he's getting the credit. You know it will look desperate. Petty, even. But you can't help it. You don’t want to. But you have to say it. “I actually did that part.” You feel embarrassed. But you had to. You had to get your worth on the record.

Over time, it becomes a habit. You document all your contributions. You steer conversations towards your achievements. It becomes an insatiable hunger. Because without the constant proof, you feel like you are nothing. Just like you always feared you were deep down. 

And as if this wasn’t bad enough. Later that year someone new joins the team. And they're a little bit better than you. At first you don’t believe it. But then their ideas keep working. And better than yours. And they’re funny too. Everyone seems to like them. You can’t help but feel resentful.

How do you prove your worth now. Being good at your job was the only thing you had. It was the one thing that kept you afloat. The one thing that gave you purpose. And now it’s gone. It’s unbearable. You have to bring them down. You have no alternative.

## Hiding Yourself
Maybe your core belief is “I am different”. 

You feel like people can spot it a mile off. It’s in everything you do. You believe no one would take you seriously if they knew the real you. So you try to hide. To exist in the shadows. You watch everyone else, trying to learn the rules. Trying to work out the correct way. But you always mess it up. Your protective mask always slips. And you can feel them sensing it.

You feel jealous. Other people just get to be. They live without thinking, and the world accepts them. But you have to put on a front for normal interactions. Small talk feels impossible. What is the correct way to answer “How are you?” or “What are you doing this weekend?”. Why did you not get a copy of this rule book?

Maybe instead it’s “I’m not a real adult”. A feeling that everyone else has a competency you failed to develop. Maybe it’s “I’m broken” or “I’m too much”.  A belief that if someone saw the real you they wouldn’t stick around. 

Maybe it’s a deep secret you hold. Something from childhood that got locked away. That still feels too dangerous to speak about, even now. You can still hear their voice sometimes *“Don’t ever tell anyone about this.”* Or maybe it’s something you were taught is shameful. Like being gay. Whatever the reason, the reality is the same. You have to hide the real you. At all costs.

So you are never fully present. You are always calculating how much can you show them. How close can you be without risking it all being taken away.

## Self Sacrifice 
Maybe you protect yourself by always giving. 

You’re the one in the friendship group that’s always there. You lend money. Buy gifts. Listen to everyone’s problems. Maybe even organise the events. You’re indispensable. You know it. They know it. But you have to be. Because you don’t believe you are worth much. 

Why would anyone keep you around unless you compensate. Overcompensation. This way your friends know your worth. Because you are constantly proving it. They’d be mad to let you go.

Maybe as a child you were constantly punished. Whether you did something wrong or not. Maybe you were taught there was something inherently bad within you. So you learnt to be a good person. To always do the right thing. To hold yourself to the highest standards. A perfectionist over your own character. 

So at least you knew you were good. Even if no one else did. 

So now. When someone thinks a bad thought about you, or says a bad comment, it still kills you inside. But your defences are ready. You know it’s not true. You know you are a good person. You try so hard to be good. You know that you are.

This is the only way you can feel safe. Being able to defend character, your actions. Because if the criticism were true. If, after all that effort, you were still bad. What could you do? What would that say about you?

## Beat Them To It
Maybe you believe everyone has the truth about you ready to go. On the tip of their tongue. Ready to hurt you. So you learn to make that self deprecating joke first. Learn to say “It doesn’t matter anyway”. Learn never to chase that dream job. Or to ask out the person who obviously likes you. You can't stop the pain of the impact. But you can dampen it.

# Erosion
Our mountains feel permanent. Insurmountable. But they’re not. They can erode. 

## Time
Think about your worst break up. How it felt like the end of the world. Life didn’t feel like living anymore. You thought you would never recover. Never find a love like that again. 

But looking back 10 years later, the memory feels distant. A bit absurd. It might as well be someone else's life. You can see they were never right for you. 

But at the time it was devastating. You cringe when you remember how you acted. Trying to be friends, even though it broke you. Pretending to be happy when they got a new partner. It's embarrassing to think back.

Back then, your whole landscape was shaped by them. Every path led back to them. The gravity of your old life together kept pulling you in. Even when every step you took. To try to reach them, only  ended with them walking further away.

You remember the song you played on repeat. The one that spoke directly to your heart. You remember your friends and their endless patience. The times you cried together over a rom-com. The way they helped you see the relationship more clearly.

And then you remember the day you bumped into them in the street, a few years later. You were genuinely pleased to see them. You said hello. And then you just carried on with your life.

Healing from our core wounds is harder. A core wound is often a mountain range. One we spent our entire lives navigating around. We built paths and protective structures to keep it safe. The paths we use to avoid it are deep and well worn. We rarely feel brave enough to start a different path and look at it head on. 

## Processing
Processing the pain of our past also helps us heal. Often this happens with a safe person. Like in therapy.

A therapist can give you the validation you never got as a child. They might say things like *“Yes, what happened to you was bad.” *or *“You did well to survive that.”* And for the first time. It becomes safe to think maybe it wasn’t your fault. Maybe these aren't failings with you. Maybe what happened to you was enough to break anyone. Maybe you're not actually broken. Maybe you can heal.

So, slowly you test them. Do they really accept you? Are they just being nice because you pay them? Can you trust them with your deepest fears?

You imagine telling them. Seeing it in their face. Their flinch. Their awkwardness. Then they have to pretend you are normal. That your behaviour wasn’t bad. Because that's their job. 

But if a therapist can’t accept you. Then you know no one can. You can’t take any risk.

Over time you slowly circle closer and closer. They seem to like you. Enjoy your company. Maybe you should trust them with the truth. But actually. What is the truth? You don’t even know it. All you have is a tangled web of memories, and feelings you were told were wrong. You can’t tell them any truth. You can’t find it yourself.

Together you work through everything. You process some painful memories. Gain some new understanding. Then suddenly it hits you both. You believe love is something you have to earn. But you can never be good enough to earn it. That’s it. That’s the rule you’ve been living your whole life around.

You knew it on some level. But you never truly knew it. You feel relieved. You can see you've been treating relationships like a job interview. And you always felt destined to fail it.

You're not cured. The mountain of unworthiness is still there. But for the first time, you can see it. You can look at it. And it’s ludicrous. Everyone deserves love. You can’t make someone love you by doing tasks.

## Counter Evidence
Nothing has the power to both hurt and heal like romantic relationships. 

Imagine you have a core belief that you are too much. It’s date seven now. And they seem to like you. You’re in the honeymoon period. Free falling down the landscape. Ecstatically happy. All your paths are aligning towards them. It’s starting to feel like meeting them was inevitable. It was fate.

You’re so happy. You’re not affected by your normal triggers. Your brain is forming new pathways. 

Take last week. You casually mentioned that it hurt when they didn't kiss you goodbye. You braced yourself for a fight. But they just said they were sorry. They were in a rush. Then, the next time they left, they went out of their way to make you feel special.

This isn't how it's supposed to work. People are supposed to get defensive. To call you needy. To hurt you back. But this person doesn't think you're too much. They’re rewriting your landscape.

Then, the next week, your mum calls. She makes a seemingly harmless comment. “Oh, your sister did that last week and said it was easy. But you’ve always found these things a bit harder, haven't you? So you did really well.” You know it's just how she is. She doesn't mean much. But it still knocks you for 6. Why is she always like this.

A lot of people have worse childhoods. This shouldn’t affect you so much. You must be weak. Sticks and stones and all that. Your mum just has a habit of making you feel worthless. Like you were the consolation prize daughter. And it really gets to you. Even though you know it shouldn’t.

Your partner comes round. They can see you’re upset. You don’t want to tell them. It feels embarrassing. Letting a little thing like this affect you so much. You know how people usually react.

They’re dismissive. They say like "All parents damage their kids." Which is just the polite way of saying your pain doesn't count. That it isn’t big enough to matter. That you should have got over it a long time ago.

They really want to know though. So you take the risk. And they listen. Suddenly, you realise three hours have passed. And they are still there. Still listening. You feel something you have never felt before. Validation. Like maybe your mum’s words were cruel. And maybe it’s ok that they hurt you so much. 

And maybe, just maybe your emotions are valid. Maybe you aren't too much. Maybe people don’t leave when they know you better. Maybe sometimes you are emotional. Sometimes you do cry. But that’s ok. They will love you anyway.

## Resolving Friction
But inevitably one day. When you are both stressed. And you both have other things on your mind. You have an argument. And it’s a big one. Your partner was supposed to meet your parents, but they cancelled at the last minute. Said they had to work. It feels suspicious. You're not sure you believe them.

That evening you try to talk to them. But they aren’t listening. You’re feeling unheard and dismissed. You don’t know what to do. They don’t seem to be able to hear you. In your frustration you tell them they’re a rubbish partner. They storm off and won’t answer your calls. It all feels so sudden. So out of character.

But it turns out your mountains directly oppose each other. Your “I’m too much” has collided with their “I’m not enough”. By trying to get down your mountain, you pushed them up theirs.

Solving these patterns is where the hard work begins. Years of trial and error. Cycles of hurt and healing. Hoping that somehow you are circling towards each other rather than away. This is where the real erosion happens. And there are no easy answers.

## Opposing Mountains
Our biggest healing often happens through meeting our opposite. The person who naturally finds it hard to give what we need to heal. Anxious attachment meets avoidant. Unworthy meets incapable. True, deep healing comes from being loved by someone who has to overcome their own mountains to love you. 

It can be a gift or a curse, or both depending on the relationship.

# Holding Patterns
Eroding isn’t a given in a relationship. Our protective structures can make relationships stable. Often at the expense of erosion. 

## Careful Distance
Your partner forgot to take the bin out. Yet again. It riles you up a little bit. Not enough to start a real fight. But you can’t help but make a sarcastic comment. “I’ll take the bins out myself then shall I?”. They look at you. They know exactly what you meant. They answer you back. “Well, I did walk the dog twice today.”

You want to say more. But you know to just leave it. You said your piece. Made your point the only way you know how. Neither of you have ever worked out how to feel heard in this situation. Nothing you’ve tried has ever worked. 

You could try to tell the truth. That it made you feel uncared for. But that would hit their mountain about not being good enough. They would get defensive. Which would have sent you further up your mountain. 

You both know the games and the moves by now. 

Over time you’re drifting further apart. You still love them. But they feel so far away sometimes. 

## Oscillating Closeness 
Some couples find stability through intense cycles.

You’re very, very deeply in love. So is your partner. But you can’t seem to make it work. You seem to constantly trigger each other. Your relationship has become a battle ground. You can’t help but think. Maybe it’s just a trauma bond now. 

After a particularly bad argument you break up. Again. Maybe you have to finally accept they aren’t the one for you. You just can’t find any way to make it work. You wish you could. But this is too hard. You can’t keep living like this. 

You spend some time apart. It hurts. You just want to call them. Get back together. All your paths still lead to them. But you can’t take the pain of the relationship anymore. So instead, you’re living in a daze. Trying to find new paths. Putting yourself out there. If you force yourself to keep going, one will have to appear. It will finally lead you away from the pain. 

But then a video comes up on tiktok. About love. About how hard it is. But that it’s worth it. You’ve been so unhappy without them. Maybe the video is right, love is worth it. You don’t want to get hurt again. But you miss them. Later that night you text them casually. You just want to know if they are still there. 

Before you know it, you’re back together. Rolling down those hills all over again. These paths are carved deep into the landscape by now. The gravity makes it feel right. Like it’s just meant to be. It was silly to think you could live without them. 

Over time you build more and more paths through the multiple breakups. Maybe you tried dating others. You tried focusing on work. You tried finding yourself. But in the end these paths all just cycle back. They all lead back to this person. This person who can give you the instant rush of rolling down to the valley together. 

Maybe this is true love trying to find a way. Maybe it’s just dysfunction. You just don’t know. It would be easier if someone just told you. 

# False Erosion 
Sometimes we believe we are becoming a better person. That we are healing ourselves. But it’s just another form of avoidance. 

## Reassurance Seeking
You’ve read the books. Been to therapy. Done the work. Learnt to be brave and communicate your needs. Even if they aren’t always well received. You are doing what is right for you.

So it’s friday night. Your partner wants to go out with their friends. You can feel your abandonment fear creeping in. But that’s ok. You understand what to do. You just need to name it. You say to your partner. “I’m feeling really anxious about you going out. Can we just talk through my feelings first? Then you can go out.” 

You feel mature. You finally feel like you are growing. Learning to take up some space. You’ve learnt to explain your anxiety. And how it connects to your childhood wounds. 

You just need some reassurance to help with your anxiety. It’s asking for what you need. Exactly what you’re meant to do. But by the time you feel calm. They say they can’t be bothered to go out now.

They do seem a bit frustrated. You can understand that. But you’re their partner. They should want to care for you when you’re struggling. You’re just sharing your needs. What you don’t realise. Is that expressing your needs has just become a new, more enlightened form of control. 

## Being Upfront 
Maybe you have completely mapped out your own patterns. You’ve learnt to accept you are flawed, and that’s ok. It’s taken a lot of work.

You meet someone new. It’s only fair you tell them about yourself up front. “I have anxiety issues. Sometimes I need extra support. If this is too much for you, I understand”.* *You’re being clear aren’t you. You need someone who can handle you. This way you know the relationship works for both of you. Before you get too invested.

On your 5th date. Their mum calls. They look stressed. They say “I’m sorry this is really important. I need to go. I’m so sorry.” You don’t like it. If it’s not their mum it's their best friend. Or their niece. There’s always someone more important than you. You just want to feel important to your partner. It’s a familiar hurt. Because it reminds you of your emotionally distant mother always prioritising your sister. 

It’s time to stand your ground isn’t it. If they can’t prioritise you now when will they ever be able to. You are clear. You are being boundaried. “I told you this up front. You knew what you were getting into. But if I am too much for you. We’d just better end it now”. 

Now they are trapped between a rock and a hard place. Your upfront declaration has worked. You have silenced them. The relationship now runs on your terms.

## Codependence Boundary
You know all about codependence. You’ve been there. Bought the t-shirt. And you know it’s not healthy.

Partners in the past always expected too much. For you to take care of their emotions.

To come running whenever they called. They had issues. They needed to learn independence. They always wanted to change you. Never again. 

You’ve told your new partner that sometimes you need space. Sometimes you get overwhelmed and just need some time to yourself. They seemed to accept it. They said they understood. They came across reasonable at the time.

But then, in an argument. They bring it up. Hold it against you. And it triggers something in you. 

You are really trying to be a good partner in this relationship. But sometimes you push way beyond your comfort level. And they just don’t seem to get it. They don’t appreciate your efforts. 

Sometimes they message you too much. You force yourself to reply, just so you don’t hurt their feelings. Sometimes they want to cuddle too much. You do it. Even though it’s way beyond your comfort level. You don’t want to hurt their feelings. But it’s smoothening.

Can they not see how hard you are trying? It’s exhausting. You just need some space before you blow. This is for their sake too. You don’t want to hurt them. They need to understand you cannot meet all their needs. They are becoming codependent. And it’s not healthy. 

You start carving out a bit more space. You’re not trying to be mean. You want this relationship to work. You want it to be healthy. 

But they sense the distance. Even though you’ve been so careful to hide it. You don’t want to hurt their feelings. But this is just more evidence. They’re too focused on you. They need to focus on themselves. On their own independence.

Next time you see them. They try to bring it up. You shut it down. “Healthy relationships require space. Maybe you should see a therapist about why you need so much external validation”.

You mean it. You really do want this relationship to work. You need them to be healthier. Anyone would feel suffocated with what they are asking for. 

Your core belief. That you aren’t capable of intimate relationships has turned into a hard boundary. A rule your partner has no choice but to learn to follow. Neither of you are healing. Just avoiding. 

## Labeller
Maybe you really understand human behaviour. You can see every one of your partners' mountains in real time. You see all the work they need to do. And you want to help them. It’s not just for you. They would be happier too. So every time you see them acting out of insecurity you tell them. In a very supportive and caring way.

And they hear it. They acknowledge what you’re saying. They can see it too. They understand it intellectually. But it doesn't seem to be helping. They are still repeating the same patterns. Over and over. 

The issue is, you can’t heal mountains intellectually. And every time you point out their insecurity, you’re just triggering it. With pinpoint accuracy. And well, you know, that’s got to hurt.

And sometimes. They have just had a long day at work. Their mood isn't caused by their father's abandonment. It's just been a long day.

## Understanding
Even being the understanding, accommodating partner can be a form of avoidance. Maybe you believe you are unworthy of true love. You think you can only be accepted if you hide parts of yourself. That you are, simply, too much to expect people to be able to cope with.

And maybe your partner has a core belief of their own. That they are unable to love fully. That some part of them is broken. But you see them clearly. You understand them. They’re doing their best. It’s just their trauma, their upbringing, their insecurities speaking. So you are always accommodating towards them. Because you know it’s not their fault. 

But this understanding comes at a cost. It’s strengthening your own mountains. It's confirming that there are parts of you that need to be hidden away.

And you aren't helping with their mountains either. They can see they’re hurting you. That you’re trying desperately to be ok. When you’re not. So they are learning a lesson of their own. For them to be loved, their partner must be in pain. That loving them means coping with their inadequacies. And that just confirms their deepest fear. That some part of them is broken.

## Wrong Mountains
Maybe you think you know your mountains. But you haven't gone deep enough.

You think you know the problem. People don’t listen to you. It happens all the time. And it feels horrible. Hard to sit with. So this must be the mountain. Your core belief must be, “I don’t deserve to be heard.” It all makes perfect sense.

It happens everywhere. You tell your partner about your day. They just scroll on their phone. You share your ideas at work. People just talk over you. Even your friends can’t seem to listen.

So you work on a solution. You speak more assertively. You set boundaries about being interrupted. You tell your partner. “When you don’t listen to me. It really hurts. I need to feel heard in this relationship”

But somehow it gets worse. The more you demand attention. The more people stop listening. Your partner says you’re exhausting. That you always need validation. That you always steer the conversation back to yourself.

You’re confused. Aren’t you just asking for basic respect? To be heard? How can that be too much?  

But your mountain isn’t “I deserve to be heard”. It’s ”I have no worth”. It’s buried down much, much deeper. 

And every time someone doesn’t listen. It triggers your mountain. It confirms you’re worthless. 

So you built a protective structure. A boundary around being heard. But when people push back against that boundary, they aren’t just questioning the structure. They’re knocking it up against your real mountain.

And the hard truth is. You do exhaust people with your protective structure. You do always steer conversations back to you. But now people’s natural reactions hit you exactly where it hurts the most.

I’m sure many people will want me to carry on writing. To turn this into a self help guide. “10 Easy Steps to Identify Your Mountains”. But that would be disingenuous. There are no easy answers. 

I believe we have to look deep within ourselves to find what is true. Which are our best paths. But this is hard. There's so much noise. What our partner says. What our parents say. What our friends say. What our therapist says. What society says. And maybe loudest of all, what our mountains say. Deciphering the best direction to head is an almost impossible task. Especially when so many of them have their own agendas which may not align with what is best for us.

It's important to remember that we all have our own landscapes. We can’t prescribe the perfect cure for someone else. As one person’s erosion is another person’s avoidance. We should also never judge another person’s landscape. As we can never know the mountains they have and which paths are available. 

My only hope is that this framework offers a new perspective. Maybe a bit more clarity to see your own patterns. And the patterns and actions of others in your life. And maybe over time, that frees up a small amount of energy to start making slightly different choices. And maybe the first set of choices don’t work. But maybe the 6th set does. 

There are no simple solutions. Understanding doesn’t mean always empathising with others. Nor does it mean always setting boundaries. From my experience, the brain has an amazing ability to misdirect us from looking at what we really need to see. Because that’s how it learnt to keep us safe. Our mountains, however badly optimised they look from the outside, were the best solution our brains found at the time they were formed. They were made to keep us safe.

 However our brain also deeply wants to heal. But I've found the biggest sign of healing isn’t mastering techniques. It’s when you’ve realised you’ve stopped calculating the optimum way to be loved or to be appreciated. And learnt to just live.

Which is a lot easier said than done. Especially when the modern world is so damaging.
