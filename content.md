You know the feeling. You just got home from work. It’s been a long, hard day. You collapse on the sofa. You don’t have the energy for anything. You know you have to cook dinner, to do your washing. But you can’t. You can’t even begin to think about doing it. You are completely out of energy. 

Your partner comes over, and asks you how your day was. You snap. You don’t mean to. You just can’t think about anything right now. You don’t have the energy.

A lot of actions in life can be explained by not having the energy. 

## Energy Landscape
Imagine you’re a ball. Standing on a path. In front of a vast landscape. There are hills, mountains and valleys. The paths represent all the actions you could take. From changing the show on netflix to hanging up the washing. Some paths stretch out far into the distance. You can just about make out that old pathway. The one you used to dream of. Quitting your job and retraining in line with your passion. But it seems so far away these days.

The valleys are the experiences that feel good. Like a holiday with your family. Or meeting someone and falling in love. 

The mountains feel huge. They feel stressful to even think about. They represent things like not being able to afford your rent. Filling out important application forms. Or having to face your controlling boss tomorrow. That one's a well worn path. You just know he is going to be unhappy with you. Because he always is. 

Mountains can also represent things that should be easy. Things you’re meant to enjoy. Like a loving conversation with your partner. Some days even that is too hard. 

You can feel the pull of gravity drawing you to the valleys. And the effort of climbing the mountains. You know which paths you want to take. You don’t have to map them out. It’s in the feeling of the slope beneath your feet.

We can only take the routes that have paths.

## Fluctuations
Our landscapes fluctuate constantly. The ground shifts below us, and all around us. 

Little events can have dramatic consequences. Imagine this. You get an unexpected bill in the post. And suddenly you’re up a mountain that wasn’t there before. 

Or you get one dodgy look from a colleague. And instantly your anxiety is rising. Your work task now feels impossible. Two seconds ago you were fine. But now you can’t focus. You can’t think straight. You no longer have the energy. You’re up a mountain. 

Luckily a work friend walks past by chance. She notices you’re stressed. You talk it through. She listens. You realise it was probably just your paranoia anyway. So you feel much better. The mountain has gone. And you can concentrate on work again. Phew. 
 
Now imagine you’re a teenager instead. Full of life. Feeling excited. You're about to go play football with your friends. However. Just as you’re walking out the door. Your mum shouts your name. She thinks you wound up your brother on purpose. Suddenly you start feeling stressed. It’s awful. But now you can’t go out. You can’t muster up any energy. You just want to go to your bedroom. To be alone. A mountain has formed. 

Maybe you could flatten this mountain. Maybe you could defend yourself. Maybe your mum might be reasonable. Then you can calm down. And go out. Or maybe. Maybe arguing back might trigger one of her mountains. Lead to an escalation. Even more stress. And probably extra punishment. It’s not worth the risk. Better to hide your bedroom. 

Our landscapes are inherently chaotic. Like the butterfly effect. They change in unpredictable ways. Right in front of our eyes.

## Energy Limit
These stressful moments. When life pushes us too far. When everything feels too hard. When all our mental energy is taken up just trying to keep going. This is us hitting our energy limits. We lose our capacity to do pretty much anything except feel stressed. 

Here’s another example. Your child goes missing at the park. You shift to survival mode. The only thing that matters is finding them. Suddenly, even your partner's affair slips your mind. All you care about is this one task. Find your child. You’re hypervigilant. Focusing on any clues you spot. Oh wait. There they are. Everything is fine again. What a relief. 

Or maybe a more everyday scenario. You didn’t get the job you applied for. And you really wanted it. It was perfect. The thoughts spiral in your mind. You really need to get your act together. Everyone is going to think you’re a failure if you keep getting rejected from these jobs. Your mind goes over the stupid things you did. Like laughing at their jokes too hard. It came across as desperate didn’t it. And that awful answer. Why did you not think. You did a whole project on that last year. How could you not remember it. You really will never find a job if you keep being this stupid in interviews. 

You’re sitting there ruminating. You’re meant to take your girlfriend shopping. But how can you. You can’t bear to leave the house. You don’t want to have to face the real world.

Coming back to the example of snapping at your partner. You could’ve easily been nice to them. In theory anyway. But in that moment it felt beyond your abilities. The energy it would have taken to respond was beyond your limits. 

At least snapping meant the conversation was over. And they left you alone for the rest of the night. It’s not that you don’t care about them. You do love them. Your brain’s just doing its best with its limited energy. 

This mental energy limit is relatively fixed. Sometimes our energy shifts rapidly. Like when you spotted your child and you relaxed. Sometimes, it lasts weeks. Like when you’re worried about being a failure for never getting a job. Understanding this helps explain why you're not lazy or mean. You're just working within your limited energy budget.

## Planning 
Our current energy level affects how we plan. It's hard to plan our way out of a situation when we’re stressed. 

Take this example. 

Your dad died 6 months ago. It still feels awful. You hate your job. Every day feels endless. In fact there is no end in sight. How do you even begin to feel better? You’re just surviving. Trying to get through the next 5 minutes. You’re stuck at the top of a mountain with ridges all around. 

And you don’t have any energy to cross these ridges. You’re completely overwhelmed all the time already. It’s uncomfortable and stressful to even look at them. You don’t have any spare energy left to plan a way out. You’re absolutely trapped. 

You can’t face thinking about anything. Let alone the things you have to do to get down this mountain. You literally cannot even see the paths out. Even if others point them out they stay purely theoretical. They don’t feel like something you could actually do. 

Now, instead. Imagine you have to make a presentation for your course. But everytime you try to think about it it feels too much. You immediately get stressed. Actually opening the laptop and starting on it. Well that’s impossible. 

You know the consequences. You just can’t make yourself do it. You know it’s procrastination. But what can you do? You always leave it to the last minute. But somehow it just seems to work. 

The days creep by. And lo and behold. Suddenly the day before it’s due you feel the focus coming. Just as you knew it would. A mountain is rising quickly beneath your feet. You start to feel the inevitable stress of not finishing in time. Suddenly the consequences feel real. You will fail your course if you don’t start right now. Right at this very moment. Quick get the laptop.

The mountain you felt about starting has become eclipsed by a bigger, more imposing mountain. This one represents failing your course. It’s taking you up high. Up to your energy limits. But to you it feels like focus. It’s shutting down your other thoughts. You’re entering fight or flight. All just to create a presentation. 

## Relationships
Obviously life is not just full of mountains and stress. There are also moments that make it feel worthwhile. One in particular is falling in love.

Everyone knows the new relationship feeling. You feel happy. Blissful even. The world feels new, and full of fresh opportunities. Maybe last week it was hard to get out of bed. But now everything has a purpose. Your whole landscape has shifted. You’ve rolled into a new valley you’ve never been to before. And suddenly everything looks different, much brighter. You feel like a whole new person. 

And it continues. Day after day. You feel the rush of energy as you roll down the slope. Gaining momentum. You can’t stop. Even if you wanted to. And there’s no way you want to. 

Your old problems don’t seem important. Your work day is as dull as ever. But you can just fantasise about tonight. Laughing about it with your partner. They’ll love the story of your colleagues' dodgy looks. I mean what an idiot. Who do they think they are. They really need to get a life and stop being obsessed with you.

It changes everything having someone reliably there for you. Someone you trust to listen to you as you share your life. It gives you a sense of home and safety. 

Over time you stay in this lower energy state. But it starts to feel normal. Your new baseline. This new landscape has mountains too. But they’re different mountains. You have more free energy. You can take bigger risks, make big life changes. Maybe decide to stand up for yourself. Like stop talking to your emotionally abusive father once and for all.

But unfortunately life also has heartbreaks. They call things off. And suddenly you’re half way up a mountain again. Without an easy path to get down. 

To make matters worse. Your dad calls when you're feeling particularly sad. He knew you would never be able to hold on to someone so great. What a mess. He was rude to you. And you just took it. Like the old days. Why did you let him say that to you?  Why did you not stand up for yourself?

## Emotions
Our emotions guide our decisions. Listening carefully to the gradient of the slope tells us which directions to take.

Each emotion is a cocktail of brain chemicals. Giving us a crucial signal about which paths to take. You can feel the stress and anxiety of moving up a mountain. Screaming to you that you’re going the wrong way.

You can also feel the joy and happiness of rolling down a hill. It’s your emotions telling you to keep going. 

Emotions also reshape the landscape. Making it more accurate. Each little detail is fed back and mapped. They are the information you need to make better decisions. They tell you which actions you need to repeat. And which are likely to lead to catastrophic mistakes. 

It could be as simple as getting a free cake with your coffee order. Amazing. You’ve updated your landscape. And there’s a new slope leading right back to their doorway. 

Or something big and awful. Like you saw your ex with their new partner at the park. A huge mountain forms. Right over the top of that park. You’re never ever gonna go there again.

Sometimes we’re too stressed, or too busy to process the emotions in the moment. We have to wait until later. 
 
That evening your mind drifts. You can feel the emotions all over again. You really just hate them. They broke your heart. 

But wait a minute. Actually. Now you’re thinking about it. It doesn’t feel as bad as you thought. The breakup was 8 months ago. And you had that really nice first date last week. Maybe you could risk the park. Oh no. That still hurts. You definitely can’t. But still, it’s good to notice you’ve made a small amount of progress. Maybe one day you’ll be ok.

Sometimes emotions reinforce what we already know. Sometimes they reshape our landscape completely. 

You find an incredible Thai restaurant. That first curry feels so amazing. You spend all week thinking about it. Telling everyone who will listen. You are so excited to go back. The landscape has changed. 

Then three months later. You order the same curry. It still tastes exactly the same. Still amazing. But it's become normal. The emotions have been processed. The paths mapped. No need for the intensity anymore.

## Emotional Overload
Processing emotions takes energy. And when you are at your limit. That’s energy you don’t have. 

For instance, you’re a child. You just fell over, and you’ve really hurt your leg. You start crying. And your mum shouts at you for exaggerating. But you’re not. You can barely walk. Your mum's stressed. She has an important meeting and she’s running late taking you to school. It’s her fault though. She lost the house keys. But anyway. She does try. She’s just very stressed. 

You try to walk. But oh my god does it hurt. You keep going. But you're limping along very slowly. Your mum stares you straight in the eyes. She tells you “We don’t have time for this. Get yourself together. Why can’t you just be normal for once. Sometimes I wish I’d never had children” Now that one really, really does hurt. Owch. 

You fall to the floor in a ball. You can barely breathe. You’re so upset. So so upset. But now your mum is even more annoyed. She needs to get to work. So she drags you up by your arm. 

So there you are. You’re getting dragged along. You’re still upset. But now you’re more detached. What can you do to make this ok? Crying doesn’t help. Feeling sorry for yourself doesn’t help. You just need to shut off these emotions somehow. Stop listening to them. They’re not doing you any good. She treats you worse when she can see your emotions. 

You get to school. You can’t concentrate still. People try to talk to you. But you can barely hear them. You just need to get through the day. But why. What’s better about being at home. Your life is one bad situation after another. A mountain range of trauma. 

## Core Beliefs
And this is how core beliefs are formed. Often in childhood. Extreme moments that shape our landscape profoundly. Then these structures remain for much of our lives. 

We are so used to the presence of these mountains that we barely notice them. 

No. Actually. We do notice them. They are there in our every action. In our every decision. We navigate our daily lives around them. We just don’t really think about them. 

Because they’re our mountains. Our biggest insecurities. Our deepest fears. They are stressful and painful to think about. So we just don’t. But they are still there. Lurking. They’re the “truths” that we live our daily lives around. 

“I’m worthless” 

Believes the adult who was told they were a waste of space. 

They don’t dare hope someone might do them a kind deed. Or forgive them for a mistake. They’re always careful. Making sure they never put upon others. Why ask for anything when you know you’re worth nothing. They don’t want to put others in an awkward situation. Don’t want to force them to have to say the truth. They don’t want the hurt of having that pointed out yet again. 

Another child might have been taught “You’re a failure” at school. 

They noticed they were always the last to finish their work. Or the teacher came to check on them more than the others. As they got older they struggled with tests and exams. I mean it’s obvious isn’t it, they just aren’t that clever. When they grew up they also failed a lot of job interviews. But finally got a job at a supermarket. Until it closed down that is. 

Now they go to the job centre. And oh my god is it stressful. It’s so hard for them to think about getting another job. They go to so many interviews. And have to look the interviewers in the eye. Knowing they see it too. They wonder why this person bothered showing up. They’re just a failure. Why would anyone hire them? 

Another child had a single parent who never had the time to help. They were working two jobs, and were always stressed. When the child needed help tying their shoelaces, their mum was too busy. When they needed help with their maths homework, their mum was too busy. When they needed support because they were getting bullied, their mum was too busy. 

They learnt “I’m a burden”. As an adult at work they can’t ask for help. They get in trouble for failing to do tasks. But they still can’t bring themselves to ask for help. When they’re at home their partner asks them how they are. They say I’m fine. What else are they meant to do. They don’t want to burden their partner with the reality of who they are. 

Parents can also create lies in a child’s reality. Imagine a child that has no friends at school. They go home. Try to process the emotions of this experience with their mum. But she keeps telling them not to be silly. That they’re the most popular person in the class. She has her own mountains preventing her from supporting her child through this.

She makes the child perform the lie. Whenever they are upset about school. They have to repeat her mantras. But they know the truth. They just aren’t allowed to think it anymore. It gets buried down deep inside. A false narrative lives over the surface. But it’s devastatingly fragile. 

## Triggers
The more mountains someone has the higher their baseline stress. When your landscape’s full of mountains you’re always on high alert. You’re extra vigilant. Those natural fluctuations feel dangerous. Any one of them could trigger you. And you’ll be right up that mountain. You have to be so careful all the time. Particularly around your core beliefs. The sad thing is. Your optimum path. The steepest downward slope is often hidden behind the mountains. 

As demonstrated by this example. 

You just met someone perfect. But that’s what’s scary. No way would someone perfect be with you. They just don’t know you yet. They can’t see who you really are. They can’t see that you’re damaged. That you're emotionally inadequate. The dark truth you carry around with you. 

Of course they aren’t going to stick around for that.

But they’re your steepest gradient. Everything is pulling you towards them. But you can help but feel the inevitable doom. Someone who wasn’t emotionally inadequate could just roll down this hill. They’d be happy. Enjoying their new landscape. But you can feel the mountain creeping up on you. 

Now you think about it. You’re actually barely coping. Why are you not feeling happy anymore. This is what you always wanted? Isn’t it? Maybe they aren’t right for you after. If this was real love you’d know wouldn’t you. There wouldn’t be any doubts. The mountain’s rising. You can’t feel the downward slope anymore. 

The next date they seem way too into you. They got you a gift. They’re moving too fast. They’ve obviously got issues. This is awkward. The pressure is rising in you. You’ll just hurt them more then longer you leave it. It’s better if you just break up with them now. No. It’s too hard right now. You’ll send them a text later. You didn’t like their hairstyle anyway. It’s not a great loss. 

Or for the anxiously attached example. 

Your partner hasn’t replied to your text for two hours. It feels like the end of the world. You are about to be abandoned. You can just sense it. 

You’re painfully aware of your mountain. It represents “I’m too much”. You know you keep pushing people away at times like this. This is why people abandon you. This is why this person is abandoning you.

But the feeling of waiting to find out is unbearable. You literally cannot sit with it. You need to know right now. Have I been abandoned? You call them. They don’t answer. You knew it. You call them again. No answer. You’re in absolute panic. You need this to be over. Then at least you can start packing your bags, and face the reality of starting all over again. It's best to know. The phone rings, it’s your partner. They are very sorry. They left their phone in a taxi. They finally got it back. They want to know if you are ok. They know you get anxious sometimes. Phew. It was just a random fluctuation in the landscape after all. 

## Emergency Escape Routes
When you’re up a mountain. Stressed out of your mind. It feels unbearable. You can’t sit with it. You can’t wait until you calm down. It’s killing you. You need to get down. Right now. This very second. 

Your brain is in crisis. You have no ability to plan ahead. To consider the longer term consequences. You just need to get down. 

This is when we use our emergency exit strategies. The moments in our lives we are probably the least proud of. The ones that fill us with a sense of shame when we look back at them. Everyone has their own set of strategies. Heavily dependent on what worked for them in childhood. 

Let’s imagine you were the child who learnt “I am a burden”. You just got bullied at school. You’re relieved to be home. But you’re feeling really upset still. It’s hard to get it all off your mind. Your mum gets home from work. She does a double take. She can see you were crying. Oh no. 

Your mum has just worked two shifts. And had an argument with her ex. She looks at you. It sends her even further up her own mountains. This one in particular represents her insecurity about being a bad parent. She knows she is failing you. But the thought is too much for her to bear. She snaps. She needs you to be ok. She needs to stop the feeling of guilt you are creating in her. “Grow up. It’s not the end of the world. I have enough going on already. You'll push me over the edge if you keep this up”

Right you dry your eyes. You’re just making everything worse. You can see your mum visibly relax. Look she’s right. You’re fine. You don’t need to make everything worse. Just put it out of your mind. Help her bring the shopping in. That will help her calm down. Maybe she’ll have some time for you later if you help her with her stress. You’ve learnt your only way down your mountain is to block it out. 

If you give endlessness how could you be a burden? This is a strategy you carry into adulthood. Never asking for anything makes it less likely someone can trigger your devastating core belief. The problem is you’ve expanded how easily it’s triggered. Now. If someone doesn’t need your help. Then you must be an even bigger burden than you thought. You’re in the way. Even when all you’re trying to do is help. 

The next example. 

As a child you were neglected. Your parents never had time for you. The only time you got any attention was when you were causing trouble. 

And yes, your parents were angry. But at least in that moment they remembered you existed. And you could feel important. They prioritised your feelings above others too. They got told not to wind you up. To let you play on the console. Even though it wasn’t your turn. It was your little glimpse of what love feels like.

As you get older, you learn other people can be manoeuvred. And this helps you regulate when you are stressed out. Let’s imagine you have a core belief. “I will never be enough”.

Your partner wants to go out to the pub with her friends. You start to feel dysregulated, all the potential scenarios are playing out in your mind. She’s laughing at you with her friends, talking about how you failed her yesterday and she's thinking of leaving you. 

You can picture it now.  She’s getting hit on. Weighing up her options. You can just tell she won’t be coming home tonight. She’ll be staying with him. Oh actually. You’ve just remembered. There’s the new guy at work. She thinks his jokes are funny. It drives you mad.

These thoughts are getting too much to bear. You don’t want to be this person. You want to be a good partner. You try to think rationally. But it’s not working. You can’t live in this state. What can you do. She shouldn’t be making you feel this way.

You can’t help but think it. She shouldn’t be making you feel this way. If she cared she wouldn’t want you to be this distressed. Really you are just asking for what you deserve. You should call her and ask her to come home. 

You could ask her nicely. But what if she says no. She said no last time you tried to explain you were upset. And it hurt even more than it’s hurting now. It really highlighted how little she did actually cared about you. You can’t take that risk again. 

You pick up the phone. “How dare you go out and flirt with your co worker. Do you not care about me? You are making me very angry. You need to come home right now. Or I don’t know what I will do.”

Your mountain has gone, she is coming home. None of these imaginary scenarios can happen. She will be at home with you. However, she now has a brand new mountain in her landscape. She is feeling like she can’t go to the pub with her friends anymore. 

Over time your landscape becomes more manageable. She knows you just can’t cope with certain things. She’s learnt to care about you better. Not trigger you so much. Little do you know she has learnt to walk on eggshells. She’s learnt to preempt any little trigger that might set you off. Her landscape is full of new mountains. “I can’t see my friends”, “I can’t stand up for myself”, “I can’t think about my own needs”.

There are so many different emergency exit strategies. You might have learnt to ignore your emotions. Maybe through compartmentilisation, or logical dissection. Maybe distraction, through exercise, shopping, over eating, self harm or just endless scrolling through tiktok. Or suppression with drugs and alcohol. 

You might have learnt to make your emotions so loud they are impossible for others to ignore. You might beg and plead when you fear abandonment. “Please, I can’t cope without you”. “I don’t know what I will do without you”. You feel so desperate. If they could see how deeply you were hurting. Maybe then they help you down your mountain. 

You might have learnt the world doesn’t listen to your truth. Your partner wants to go away for the weekend with their family. You can already feel your abandonment mountain creeping in. You know if you asked them not to go it would cause an argument. And they would probably still go anyway. You tell them you have a sudden medical appointment you need support for because you're worried. It's slightly true. It's 3 weeks away. You do feel bad. But the guilt is manageable. At least you can sit with the guilt. You can't sit with abandonment.

You might have learnt you can't stop people hurting you. But you still need to get down your mountains. Your partner criticised you for how you handled dinner with their parents. They said you embarrassed everyone with some of your comments. Your mountain "I ruin everything" is triggered. You feel so anxious and insecure. There is no way your partner is helping with this. They have so many mummy issues it's unbelievable. Your partner is the one causing all of this. They really need to go to therapy. You begin going through all their flaws. You try to point them out nicely to them. But they are so un-self aware. They are a lost cause really. Before you know it you are down your own mountain. But enraged by your partner.

The only consistency is when people feel the unbearable, they will do absolutely anything to get down. 

## Protective Structures
When our world is full of mountains we can be triggered by the innocuous. Every interaction, every movement causes anxiety. Could I be about to be sent up my mountain? We start build structures around our mountains to protect us. These are our attempts to stop our mountains being touched. The protective structures we build often look like entitlement. We are entitled to our structures because we are entitled not to be hurt. 

Someone who grew up believing “I have no autonomy” might feel the need to have protective structures to prevent others impacting their life. Imagine this. You grew up believing "I have no autonomy." Every decision was made for you. What you wore. Who you could see. When you did every activity. Your life happened to you.

Now you need to know everything. What your partner is doing all the time. Where they are. Who they are with. You check their phone constantly. Not because you don't trust them. But because their actions impact you. If they stay out an hour later than they said. Then that impacts you. You would sit at home feeling powerless all over again. You don't want to control them. You just want to know how to control your own life.

Maybe even that doesn't work. Maybe you've learnt the world is cruel. Everyone is playing their own games. Looking out for themselves. If you don't play the game you lose automatically. 

Your partner wants to go out with their friends. You know what's really happening. Their friends think you're bad. That they should leave you. Your partner only tells them one side. They don't know the whole situation. You think about the comment you overheard recently. About how they think your partner talks too much. You've twisted it slightly. You know you have. But it wouldn't work if you didn't.

You see your partners' face drop. They stay home with you.

Maybe you did lie a little. But everyone does. At least you are protecting yourself. You're not naive. You've been stomped on too many times to play fair.

Maybe you have the mountain representing “I have no value”. You feel hurt every time someone doesn’t appreciate you enough to give back equally. You start keeping track of every interaction and kind deed. Start demanding every meal is split 50 50. Every chore is assigned 50 50. If you do someone a favour you make sure you don’t feel taken advantage of and you get your worth back.
 
Maybe you have a mountain representing "I have no value". Every time they forget to reciprocate it hurts. Last night you listened to your partner talk for an hour about their work. Tonight they are going out with their friends when you want to talk. They've not done the washing up. And it was their turn. You paid for the last 2 meals out. Why do they not value you enough to remember. So you start keeping a mental scorecard. Maybe a real spreadsheet. Every interaction is weighed up and measured. You can't help it. It's automatic. You start making rules. Bills have to be split exactly. Chores assigned rigidly. Then at least your value feels provable.

Maybe your worth is tied to your achievements. You've been working for months on a challenging project. You are really proud of what you and the team achieved. At a meeting your colleague explains your contribution without stating it was you. Everyone is impressed. But your chest tightens. You know it will look desperate. Petty even. But you have to say it. "I actually did that part". You need your worth on the record. You document all your contributions. Steering all conversations to mention your achievements. It becomes an insatiable hunger, but without it you feel like you're nothing. Just like you always feared.

Maybe you have a core belief “I am broken” or “I am different”. You feel like if anyone saw you fully they would see it. So you try to exist in the shadows. Hiding your true self. You watch everyone. Trying to learn the correct way to live. Everyone else seems to “get it” automatically. They are lucky. The way they exist naturally is normal. They don’t have to put on a front just to have a conversation about their lives. 

## Erosion
Our mountains aren’t permanent.

When you are somewhere safe. Maybe with someone safe you can begin the slow process of processing the past. Talk about experiences you shut down at the time. The memories you never emotionally processed. Sometimes a song or a painting captures something true that captures your attention. Maybe a tradition gives you the structure to grieve. 

Our mountains can also be eroded by counter evidence. The belief we are unlovable can slowly be eroded by being loved. The believe we can’t ask for help, by someone finding fulfilment in helping us. The belief we are a failure being eroded by success. 
 
Erosion is not easy. It means risking your vulnerabilities. And sometimes it doesn’t pay off. Particularly when your vulnerability triggers someone else’s mountains. 

Nothing has the power to both hurt and heal like romantic relationships. 

It starts with the honeymoon period. You’re freefalling down the landscape. You feel the gravity of the valley pulling you towards them. All your paths seem to point towards them. It feels like meeting them was inevitable. 

You both feel so happy. You’re not affected by your normal triggers. Your landscape is getting constant update signals. You casually mentioned they hurt you when they didn’t kiss you goodbye. They said they were sorry. They were in a rush. Next time they go out of their way to make you feel special. This isn’t meant to be happening. People are meant to get defensive and hurt you. This person doesn’t think you’re worthless. This person doesn't think you're a failure. Your landscape is being deeply rewritten. 

But inevitably one day. You are both stressed. Both have other things on your mind. And you have an argument. And it’s a big one. Your partner was meant to meet your parents today. But last minute they said they had to work instead. It’s a bit suspicious. You aren’t sure if you believe them. 

That evening you try to talk to them about it. But they aren’t listening. You’re feeling unheard and dismissed. You tell them they are a rubbish partner. It turns out you’re mountains direct oppose each other. “I am unlovable” vs “I am incapable of loving”. 

Solving these patterns is where the hard work begins. Where the real erosion happens. 

Unfortunately, our biggest healing often happens through meeting our opposite. The person who naturally finds it hard to give what we need to heal. Anxious attachment meets avoidant. Unworthy meets incapable. To be loved by someone who has to overcome their own mountains to love you. 

It can be a gift or a curse, or both depending on the relationship.

## Holding Patterns
Our protective structures can help us make relationships stable. Sometimes at the expense of erosion. 

Imagine your partner forgot to take the bin out. This links to your mountain about not being considered. You’re not having an emergency response. But you can’t help but make a sarcastic comment. “I’ll take the bins out myself then shall I?”. They look at you and answered back “Well I did walk the dog twice today”. You know to just leave it now. Neither of you have ever worked out how to feel heard in this scenario. Nothing you’ve tried has worked. You could tell them the truth. Not taking the bin out made you feel uncared for. But they would have got even more defensive. It would have hit their mountain about not being good enough. Which would have sent you further up your mountain. You both know the moves and the game by now. 

Over time you’re drifting further apart. You love them still. But they feel so far away sometimes. 

Some couples stabilize through distance and careful avoidance. Others through intense cycles.

You and your partner have a deep love. But you can’t help but trigger each other. The relationship has become a battle ground. After a particularly bad argument you break up. Again. Maybe you have to accept that you just don’t work. You wish you did. But this is just too hard. 

You both spend time trying to move on. Not think about the gravitational pull. You’re trying to find new paths that can lead you away. But then a video comes up on tiktok. About love. And how it’s hard but it’s worth it. You’ve been so unhappy without them. Maybe love is worth it. You text them casually. You just want to know if they are still there. 

Before you know it you are back together. Rolling down those hills all over again. The gravity makes it feel right. It’s meant to be isn’t it. Over time you build more and more paths out through the multiple breakups. But in the end these paths all just cycle back. They all lead back to this person. And every time you experience the rush down. 

## False Erosion 
Sometimes we believe we are becoming a better person. That we are healing ourselves. But it’s just a form of avoidance. 

Even being the understanding, accommodating partner can be a form of avoidance. Maybe you have an insecurity about being unworthy of love. And they have an insecurity of being unable to love. You understand them. Their behaviour is just their insecurity speaking. So you are completely accommodating towards them. You do everything you can to make them feel comfortable. Because it’s not their fault. It’s their trauma. But it’s at the expense of your own mountains. 

And you aren't helping them with mountains either. They can see they are hurting you. And you’re just trying to be ok with it. They’re learning they aren’t good enough at loving you. That even their best love hurts you. They’re learning their partner has to bend and twist themselves to accommodate their inadequacies. And you are learning there are parts of yourself you have to keep away from them. Your own needs don’t fit into a loving relationship.  Your comfort and wellbeing   are too much to ask for. 

Sometimes we think we are growing. We are learning the language of trauma. Learning more about ourselves and our natural responses. But it’s still a form of avoidance of our own mountains. 

You’ve read the books. You’ve been to therapy. You’ve done the work. You can communicate your needs now. 

So this time your partner wants to go out with their friends. You feel your abandonment mountain rising. But this time you’ve learnt to name it. “I’m feeling really anxious about you going out. Can we talk through my feelings first?”

This is mature of you isn’t it. Something to be proud of. Finally you feel like you’re growing. You explain your anxiety. How it connects to your childhood wounds. You just need some reassurance. This is asking for what you need. Exactly what you are meant to do. But by the time you feel calm, it’s too late for them to go out. Or they just want to stay in to care for you instead. 

They do seem a bit frustrated. You can understand that. But you’re their partner. They should want to care for you when you are struggling. You’re just sharing your needs. You don’t realise it’s just become a new, enlightened form of control. 

Maybe in your next relationship you have done so much growth you tell them about yourself up front. “I have anxiety issues. Sometimes I need extra support. If this is too much for you I understand”. You’re being clear aren’t you. You need someone who can handle you. This way you know the relationship works for both of you. 

When they trigger your abandonment wound. They say “This is really important. I need to go. I’m sorry” You are clear and boundaried. “I told you this up front. You knew what you were getting into. But if I am too much for you. We’d just better end it now”. They're trapped. 

Here’s another example. 

Maybe you know all about codependence. You know people have a tendency to expect others to take care of their own emotions and responses. You like to maintain independence. You’ve had trouble with partners who tried to change that in the past. It didn’t work out. So never again. 

You’re up front with them. “Look, sometimes I just need some space. I think I need four nights a week completely to myself.” They seem to accept it. Be reasonable. But then in an argument your partner brings it up. Holds it against you. 

And it triggers something in you. You really are trying in this relationship. They message you too much sometimes. But you always make time to reply. Sometimes they want to cuddle too much. You understand it. So you have been cuddling when maybe it’s started to feel uncomfortable. Can they not see they are too much. It’s exhausting. They need to realise you can’t meet all their needs. They are becoming codependent. This is not healthy. 

You start trying to carve out a bit more space. Not to be mean. You just want this relationship to work. You need to try to make it heathy. They seem to sense it. Even though you’ve been careful to be subtle. This is even more proof they are not learning to focus on themselves and their independence. 

When they bring it up. You tell them clearly. “Healthy relationships require space. Maybe you should see a therapist about why you need so much external validation” You mean it. You really do want this relationship to work. You need them to be healthier. Anyone would feel suffocated with what they are asking for. 

Your insecurity about not being able to give enough in a relationship has turned into a hard boundary for your partner to follow. Neither of you are healing. 

Maybe you take this even further. You can see every one of your partner’s mountains very clearly. You can see all the work they have to do. And you want to help them. It would make things easier for both of you. Your relationship would be happier. So every time you see them acting out of insecurity you tell them. Calmly and clearly. In a supportive way. 

And they hear it. They acknowledge what you are saying. They can see some truth. But the issue is you can’t heal mountains intellectually. No amount of knowing their mountains will help them get down them. And you’re pin point accuracy to name their mountains. Well you know. That’s got to hurt. 

And sometimes they have just had a long day at work. Maybe it’s not caused by their fathers’ abandonment.

Here’s another example. 

Maybe you think you know your mountains. But you have them wrong. You think your problem is people don’t listen to you. You have a mountain about not deserving to be heard. It makes sense. It keeps happening. Every relationship. Even at work. You tell your partner about your day. They just scroll on their phone. You share your ideas at work. People talk over you.

So you work on speaking more assertively. Setting boundaries about being interrupted. You tell your partner. “When you don’t listen to me. It really hurts. I need to feel heard in this relationship”

But somehow it gets worse. The more you demand attention. The more people stop listening. Your partner says you’re exhausting. You always need validation. Always steer conversation back to yourself. 

You’re confused. Aren’t you just asking for basic respect. To be heard? How can that be too much?  

But your mountain isn’t “I deserve to be heard”. It’s” I have no value”. And it’s hidden much much deeper. Every time someone doesn’t listen. It triggers your mountain. Confirms you’re worthless. 

But you’ve built a protective structure for it. Boundaries about being heard. But whenever someone questions your structure. You feel your true mountain. 

And the hard truth is. You do exhaust people with your protective structure. You do always steer conversations back to you. But now people’s natural reactions hit you exactly where it hurts.

Note:
The mathematical formulation of this framework is trivial to derive. Through evolution emotions became the proxy for energy. And we started optimising emotional responses rather than energy.  Because this allowed the reward to gradually move further away from the outcome. The sum of emotions for each action should tend to the energy change. Though in reality, life is not that clean. Emotions are blurry cocktails of brain chemicals. Changes in emotions are measured by changes in these brain chemicals. Each with their own learning properties, including decay rates and cut offs. Processing emotions allows us to learn from them. Minimising the landscape or prediction error. But this consumes energy. Energy is ATP. It’s deep reinforcement learning with gradient descent.
