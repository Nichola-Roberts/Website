You know the feeling. You just got home from work. It’s been a long, hard day. You collapse on the sofa. You don’t have the energy for anything. You know you have to cook dinner, to do your washing. But you can’t. You can’t even begin to think about doing it. You are completely out of energy. 

Your partner comes over, and asks you how your day was. You snap. You don’t mean to. You just can’t think about anything right now. You don’t have the energy.

A lot of actions in life can be explained by not having the energy. 

## Energy Landscape
Imagine you’re a ball. Standing on a path. In front of a vast landscape. There are hills, mountains and valleys. These represent all the actions you could take. From changing the show on netflix to hanging up the washing. Some paths stretch out far into the distance. You can just about make out that old pathway. The one you used to dream of. Quitting your job and retraining in line with your passion. But it seems so far away these days.

The valleys are the experiences that feel good. Like a holiday with your family. Or meeting someone and falling in love. 

The mountains feel huge. They feel stressful to even think about. They represent things like not being able to afford your rent. Filling out important application forms. Or having to face your controlling boss tomorrow. That one's a well worn path. You just know he is going to be unhappy with you. Because he always is. 

Mountains can also represent things that should be easy. Things you’re meant to enjoy. Like a loving conversation with your partner. Some days even that is too hard. 

You can feel the pull of gravity drawing you to the valleys. And the effort of climbing the mountains. You know which paths you want to take. You don’t have to map them out. It’s in the feeling of the slope beneath your feet.

## Fluctuations
Our landscapes fluctuate constantly. The ground shifts below us, and all around us. 

Little events can have dramatic consequences. Imagine this. You get an unexpected bill in the post. And suddenly you’re up a mountain that wasn’t there before. 

Or you get one dodgy look from a colleague. And instantly your anxiety is rising. Your work task now feels impossible. Two seconds ago you were fine. But now you can’t focus. You can’t think straight. You no longer have the energy. You’re up a mountain. 

Luckily a work friend walks past by chance. She notices you’re stressed. You talk it through. She listens. You realise it was probably just your paranoia anyway. So you feel much better. The mountain has gone. And you can concentrate on work again. Phew. 
 
Now imagine you’re a teenager instead. Full of life. Feeling excited. You're about to go play football with your friends. However. Just as you’re walking out the door. Your mum shouts your name. She thinks you wound up your brother on purpose. Suddenly you start feeling stressed. It’s awful. But now you can’t go out. You can’t muster up any energy. You just want to go to your bedroom. To be alone. A mountain has formed. 

Maybe you could flatten this mountain. Maybe you could defend yourself. Maybe your mum might be reasonable. Then you can calm down. And go out. Or maybe. Maybe arguing back might trigger one of her mountains. Lead to an escalation. Even more stress. And probably extra punishment. It’s not worth the risk. Better to hide your bedroom. 

Our landscapes are inherently chaotic. Like the butterfly effect. They change in unpredictable ways. Right in front of our eyes.

## Energy Limit
These stressful moments. When life pushes us too far. When everything feels too hard. When all our mental energy is taken up just trying to keep going. This is us hitting our energy limits. We lose our capacity to do pretty much anything except feel stressed. 

Here’s another example. Your child goes missing at the park. You shift to survival mode. The only thing that matters is finding them. Suddenly, even your partner's affair slips your mind. All you care about is this one task. Find your child. You’re hypervigilant. Focusing on any clues you spot. Oh wait. There they are. Everything is fine again. What a relief. 

Or maybe a more everyday scenario. You didn’t get the job you applied for. And you really wanted it. It was perfect. The thoughts spiral in your mind. You really need to get your act together. Everyone is going to think you’re a failure if you keep getting rejected from these jobs. Your mind goes over the stupid things you did. Like laughing at their jokes too hard. It came across as desperate didn’t it. And that awful answer. Why did you not think. You did a whole project on that last year. How could you not remember it. You really will never find a job if you keep being this stupid in interviews. 

You’re sitting there ruminating. You’re meant to take your girlfriend shopping. But how can you. You can’t bear to leave the house. You don’t want to have to face the real world.

Coming back to the example of snapping at your partner. You could’ve easily been nice to them. In theory anyway. But in that moment it felt beyond your abilities. The energy it would have taken to respond was beyond your limits. 

At least snapping meant the conversation was over. And they left you alone for the rest of the night. It’s not that you don’t care about them. You do love them. Your brain’s just doing its best with its limited energy. 

This mental energy limit is relatively fixed. Sometimes our energy shifts rapidly. Like when you spotted your child and you relaxed. Sometimes, it lasts weeks. Like when you’re worried about being a failure for never getting a job. Understanding this helps explain why you're not lazy or mean. You're just working within your limited energy budget.

## Planning 
Our current energy level affects how we plan. It's hard to plan our way out of a situation when we’re stressed. 

Take this example. 

Your dad died 6 months ago. It still feels awful. You hate your job. Every day feels endless. In fact there is no end in sight. How do you even begin to feel better? You’re just surviving. Trying to get through the next 5 minutes. You’re stuck at the top of a mountain with ridges all around. 

And you don’t have any energy to cross these ridges. You’re completely overwhelmed all the time already. It’s uncomfortable and stressful to even look at them. You don’t have any spare energy left to plan a way out. You’re absolutely trapped. 

You can’t face thinking about anything. Let alone the things you have to do to get down this mountain. You literally cannot even see the paths out. Even if others point them out they stay purely theoretical. They don’t feel like something you could actually do. 

Now, instead. Imagine you have to make a presentation for your course. But everytime you try to think about it it feels too much. You immediately get stressed. Actually opening the laptop and starting on it. Well that’s impossible. 

You know the consequences. You just can’t make yourself do it. You know it’s procrastination. But what can you do? You always leave it to the last minute. But somehow it just seems to work. 

The days creep by. And lo and behold. Suddenly the day before it’s due you feel the focus coming. Just as you knew it would. A mountain is rising quickly beneath your feet. You start to feel the inevitable stress of not finishing in time. Suddenly the consequences feel real. You will fail your course if you don’t start right now. Right at this very moment. Quick get the laptop.

The mountain you felt about starting has become eclipsed by a bigger, more imposing mountain. This one represents failing your course. It’s taking you up high. Up to your energy limits. But to you it feels like focus. It’s shutting down your other thoughts. You’re entering fight or flight. All just to create a presentation. 

## Relationships
Obviously life is not just full of mountains and stress. There are also moments that make it feel worthwhile. One in particular is falling in love.

Everyone knows the new relationship feeling. You feel happy. Blissful even. The world feels new, and full of fresh opportunities. Maybe last week it was hard to get out of bed. But now everything has a purpose. Your whole landscape has shifted. You’ve rolled into a new valley you’ve never been to before. And suddenly everything looks different, much brighter. You feel like a whole new person. 

And it continues. Day after day. You feel the rush of energy as you roll down the slope. Gaining momentum. You can’t stop. Even if you wanted to. And there’s no way you want to. 

Your old problems don’t seem important. Your work day is as dull as ever. But you can just fantasise about tonight. Laughing about it with your partner. They’ll love the story of your colleagues' dodgy looks. I mean what an idiot. Who do they think they are. They really need to get a life and stop being obsessed with you.

It changes everything having someone reliably there for you. Someone you trust to listen to you as you share your life. It gives you a sense of home and safety. 

Over time you stay in this lower energy state. But it starts to feel normal. Your new baseline. This new landscape has mountains too. But they’re different mountains. You have more free energy. You can take bigger risks, make big life changes. Maybe decide to stand up for yourself. Like stop talking to your emotionally abusive father once and for all.

But unfortunately life also has heartbreaks. They call things off. And suddenly you’re half way up a mountain again. Without an easy path to get down. 

To make matters worse. Your dad calls when you're feeling particularly sad. He knew you would never be able to hold on to someone so great. What a mess. He was rude to you. And you just took it. Like the old days. Why did you let him say that to you?  Why did you not stand up for yourself?
